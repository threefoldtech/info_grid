### Base

  - Ex. ***oc98newcloud*.gent02.dev.grid.tf**

- Enter administrator information including **Username** and **Password**.
  - This admin user will have full permission on the deployed instance.
- Select a capacity package:
    - **Small**: {cpu: 2, memory: 8, diskSize: 250 }
    - **Medium**: {cpu: 2, memory: 16, diskSize: 500 }
    - **Large**: {cpu: 4, memory: 32, diskSize: 1000 }
    - Or choose a **Custom** plan
- Choose the network
   - `Public IPv4` flag gives the virtual machine a Public IPv4
- Enable the `Dedicated` flag to retrieve only dedicated nodes 
- Enable the `Certified` flag to retrieve only certified nodes 
- Choose the location of the node
   - `Country`
   - `Farm Name`
- Choose the node to deploy on 
- Enable the `Custom Domain` flag to use a custom domain
- Choose a gateway node to deploy your ownCloud instance on.

Once you've set the deployment parameters, you can click on **Deploy**.
