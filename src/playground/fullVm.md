- Fill in the instance name: it's used to reference the Full VM in the future.
- Choose the image from the drop down (e.g Alpine, Ubuntu) or you can click on `Other` and manually specify the flist URL and the entrypoint.
- Select a capacity package:
    - **Minimum**: {cpu: 1, memory: 1024, diskSize: 25 }
    - **Standard**: {cpu: 2, memory: 4096, diskSize: 50 }
    - **Recommended**: {cpu: 4, memory: 4096, diskSize: 100}
    - Or choose a **Custom** plan
- Choose the network
   - `Public IPv4` flag gives the virtual machine a Public IPv4
   - `Public IPv6` flag gives the virtual machine a Public IPv6
   - `Planetary Network` to connect the Virtual Machine to Planetary network
   - `Wireguard Access` to add a wireguard acces to the Virtual Machine
- `GPU` flag to add GPU to the Virtual machine
  - To deploy a Full VM with GPU, you first need to [rent a dedicated node](../dashboard/portal/dashboard_portal_dedicated_nodes.md#filter-and-reserve-a-gpu-node)
- `Dedicated` flag to retrieve only dedicated nodes 
- `Certified` flag to retrieve only certified nodes 
- Choose the location of the node
   - `Country`
   - `Farm Name`
- Choose the node to deploy the Full Virtual Machine on

   - Disk name 
   - Disk size


in the bottom of the page you can see a list of all of the virual machines you deployed. you can click on `Show details` for more details

## Difference Between Full Virtual Machine and Micro Virtual Machine

- Full VM contains a default disk attached to it which is not the case in the Micro VM where you needed to make sure to attach a disk to it or the VM will fail
- The default disk is mounted on / so if you want to attach any additional disks, you have to choose a different mounting point
- Only cloud init flists can be deployed on Full VM. You can check official Threefold flists [here](https://hub.grid.tf/tf-official-vms)
- In Full VM, you need to mount the additional disks manually after the VM is deployed

## Manually Mounting Additional Disk

- You can follow the following commands to add your disk manually:

### Check all disks attached to the VM

```bash
fdisk -l
```

### The additional disk won't be mounted and you won't find it listed

```bash
df -h
```

### Create mount dir

```bash
sudo mkdir /hdd6T
```

### New file system

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb
```

### Mount drive

```bash
sudo mount /dev/vdb /hdd6T/
```
