<h1> ThreeFold Playground </h1>

Welcome to the *Playground* section of the ThreeFold Manual, your portal to a user-friendly and immersive experience in deploying solutions on the TFGrid! 

The ThreeFold Playground is a revolutionary platform that simplifies the deployment process, allowing users to effortlessly interact with the TFGrid using intuitive web components known as weblets. 

## What is the ThreeFold Playground?

The ThreeFold Playground is a dynamic environment designed for both seasoned developers and newcomers alike. It offers a seamless and accessible browser experience, making it easy to deploy solutions on the TFGrid through the use of weblets. 

In the context of the Playground, a weblet is a compiled JavaScript web component that can be effortlessly embedded within the HTML page of a web application. This modular approach allows for flexible and intuitive interactions, facilitating a user-friendly deployment process.

The backend for the weblets is introduced with the [Javascript Client](../javascript/grid3_javascript_readme.md) which communicates to TFChain over RMB.

## Advantages

- It is a non-code easy way to deploy a whole solution on the TFGrid.
- It is 100% decentralized, there is no server involved.

## Playground
Playground is a Vue app that has the weblets embedded. You can access the ThreeFold Playground on different TF Chain networks.
- [https://playground.dev.grid.tf](https://playground.dev.grid.tf) for Dev net.
- [https://playground.qa.grid.tf](https://playground.qa.grid.tf) for QA net.
- [https://playground.test.grid.tf](https://playground.test.grid.tf) for Test net.
- [https://playground.grid.tf](https://playground.grid.tf) for Main net.

## Limitations

- Regarding browser support, we're only supporting Google Chrome browser (and thus Brave browser) at the moment with more browsers to be supported soon.
- Deploys one thing at a time.
- Might take sometime to deploy a solution like Peertube, so you should wait a little bit until it's fully running.
