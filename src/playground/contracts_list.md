## Contracts List Information

The **Contracts List** includes the following information about each contract:

- **ID**
  - The contract ID
- **Type**
  - The contract type
- **State**
  - The contract state
  - It can take the following values: `Created`, `Deleted` and `GracePeriod`
- **Billing Rate** 
  - This is shown in TFT/Hour
- **Solution Type**
- **Solution Name**
- **Created At**
  - The moment of creation of the contract
- **Expiration**
  - This only appears if the contract is in `GracePeriod`
- **Node ID**
  - The node ID on which the contract is deployed
- **Node Status**
  - The status of the node (e.g. `Up`, `Down`)
- **Details**
  - This button will display the detailed information of the contract

## Delete a Contract

To delete a contract, use the checkbox on the left to select the contract and then click on the button **Delete**. You can delete more than one contract at once.

### Important Note

Note that if you want to delete a deployment, it is advised to delete it on the deployment page itself and not on the **Contracts** page. This will ensure that you do not delete contracts that are needed for other deployments.
