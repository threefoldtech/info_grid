## Welcome to the ThreeFold Ecosystem

Welcome to the ThreeFold ecosystem, your gateway to a global and sustainable network. Get ready to embark on a journey to understand the inner workings of the ThreeFold Grid. 

In this section, we will guide you through the essential aspects of the ThreeFold Grid, ensuring that you grasp the intricacies of the grid and its interconnected operations. Additionally, we will delve into TFChain, our backbone blockchain infrastructure, and uncover the building blocks of our grid, known as 3Nodes.


## ThreeFold Grid: A Global & Sustainable Network

The ThreeFold Grid is a remarkable network consisting of autonomous storage and compute Internet capacity. It is sustained by dedicated individuals, known as **ThreeFold Farmers**, who have contributed over 80,000,000 GB of storage and 20,000 cores to the grid. This massive capacity is globally available, neutral, and sustainable.

To ensure easy discovery by purchasers, the IT capacity within the ThreeFold Grid is indexed and registered on the **TFChain**. This platform serves as a comprehensive directory, simplifying the process of finding and accessing the desired resources. The ThreeFold Grid supports any application that can run on Linux, guaranteeing compatibility and flexibility. Moreover, it offers additional benefits, including enhanced privacy, security, proximity to end-users, and a significantly lower cost compared to traditional alternatives.

## Local Production and Allocation of Internet Capacity

In a similar manner to purchasing electricity or other utilities, the internet capacity provided by the ThreeFold Grid is produced and allocated locally. This decentralized approach empowers digital service and application providers to host their offerings closer to end-users, resulting in exceptional performance, competitive pricing, and improved profit margins. The ThreeFold Grid's cost-effectiveness and environmentally-friendly nature make it an ideal choice for businesses and individuals alike, creating a win-win situation that combines economic efficiency with sustainability.



## ThreeFold Grid Capacity

The **ThreeFold Grid Capacity** refers to the [extensive pool](https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics) of **decentralized storage and compute resources** available within the ThreeFold Grid ecosystem. It encompasses a vast network of autonomous nodes contributed by ThreeFold Farmers, resulting in a highly scalable and resilient infrastructure. This capacity is distributed globally, providing users with a reliable and efficient platform to store and process data, to run applications, and to deliver digital services, providing the world with the largest decentralized, peer-2-peer infrastructure.



## How the ThreeFold Grid Works

The ThreeFold Grid operates on a consumption and generation model similar to how people generate and consume electricity from the electrical grid. Just as individuals consume electricity from the electrical grid to power their homes and businesses, users of the ThreeFold Grid consume internet capacity to store data, to run applications, and to deliver digital services. At the same time, the ThreeFold Grid generates its capacity through the contributions of ThreeFold Farmers, who provide decentralized storage and compute resources to the grid. The **TF Dashboard** connects users with farmers, making it easy to get the internet capacity you need. It's like a marketplace where you can find resources. Users pay with ThreeFold tokens (**TFT**) for the capacity they use, and farmers earn TFT as rewards for providing resources. It is like paying your utility bill while power companies earn money by supplying electricity.

This user-friendly model allows individuals and businesses to tap into a reliable and scalable infrastructure, accessing the resources they need while contributing to the overall capacity of the grid in a seamless and sustainable manner. Just like the electrical grid, the ThreeFold Grid offers a user-friendly and accessible approach to meet the ever-growing demand for internet capacity and digital services.


## TFChain: The Backbone Blockchain Infrastructure

__TFChain__, also known as __ThreeFold Chain__, is the powerful blockchain that orchestrates the interactions within the ThreeFold Grid ecosystem. TFChain is like the control center of the ThreeFold Grid that provides users with a range of key functionalities such as:

- Users Registration
- Farms Management (registration and IP management)
- Fund Transfers
- Billing and consumptions reports
- And much more

## The Farmers: Empowering the ThreeFold Grid

In the thriving ThreeFold ecosystem, dedicated individuals, affectionately known as **Farmers**, wield pivotal roles in fortifying the bedrock of the ThreeFold Grid. These Farmers make vital contributions to the network by harnessing one or more 3Nodes, which are meticulously registered on TFChain, our steadfast blockchain infrastructure.

A 3Node farm can be composed of one or more nodes. 3Node farms empower Farmers to streamline their infrastructure efficiently. Imagine a Farmer having two 3Nodes in Belgium and five 3Nodes in France, each under a unique farm ID. This smart arrangement not only simplifies management, but also mirrors the nodes' physical locations.

The Farmers' unwavering dedication in deploying and maintaining their nodes serves as the lifeblood of the ThreeFold Grid, fostering its growth and resilience. Their tireless efforts translate into an abundant supply of decentralized internet capacity, benefiting both individuals and businesses with secure, efficient, and cost-effective resources.

The **TF Dashboard** serves as an indispensable tool for Farmers, facilitating node registration and resource management. It's akin to a control panel for power plant operators, enabling seamless oversight of their generators.

The resolute commitment of our Farmers lies at the heart of building a robust and sustainable infrastructure that propels the future of the internet. These dedicated individuals earn **ThreeFold tokens** as a well-deserved reward for their invaluable contributions, much like power companies earn revenue by supplying electricity to the electrical grid.



## 3Nodes: Unleashing the Power of Raw Capacity

__3Nodes__ are the driving force behind the ThreeFold Grid, acting as __specialized computers that run the remarkable Zero-OS software__. Think of a 3Node as a unique breed of operating system, designed to expose raw compute, storage, and network capacity in a seamless and efficient manner.

With Zero-OS at its core, a 3Node takes care of various essential tasks to ensure optimal performance.

## Provisioning: Empowering Resource Deployment

Now that we've covered the fundamental components of the ThreeFold Grid, it's time to explore the exciting world of provisioning. Provisioning is the process of requesting and setting up resources on the ThreeFold Grid. So, how can we initiate a provisioning request to the Zero-OS operating system? Let's find out!

While there are many ways to request and set up resources on the ThreeFold Grid, we present here two of the main ones:

- [Terraform](../terraform/terraform_readme.md)
- [Typescript Client](../javascript/grid3_javascript_readme.md)

Here's how it works. First, we gather the necessary deployment information, specifying the workloads we want to deploy. Using either Terraform or the Typescript Client, we create a contract on the blockchain. This contract acts as an agreement between the user and a dedicated 3Node, ensuring that the required resources will be provisioned on the user's behalf.

Once the contract is in place, the 3Node diligently reports its resource consumption to the blockchain at regular intervals. As a result, the associated fees are automatically deducted from the user's account, ensuring a seamless and transparent billing process based on actual resource consumption.

With the provisioning process, you have the power to effortlessly deploy the resources you need, thanks to the harmony between the blockchain, 3Nodes, and the Zero-OS operating system.

## Conclusion

Now that you have a clear understanding of how the ThreeFold ecosystem works, it's time to dive in and get started! Whether you're a user looking to leverage the power of the grid or a potential Farmer eager to contribute, you're now equipped with a general overview of the ThreeFold ecosystem.
