# ThreeFold Grid Manual

*Welcome to the ThreeFold Manual!*

This manual is organized in two main sections: 

- [ThreeFold Knowledge Base](../knowledge_base/knowledge_base.md)

The *ThreeFold Knowledge Base* section contains all information needed to understand how the whole ThreeFold ecosystem works. 

The *ThreeFold Documentation* section contains all the practical information of the ThreeFold Grid, from general information covering the multi-functional [Dashboard](../documentation/dashboard/dashboard.md), [TFT](../documentation/threefold_token/threefold_token.md) and our community-based [FAQ](../documentation/faq/faq.md), to specific tutorials for [developers](../documentation/developers/developers.md), [farmers](../documentation/farmers/farmers.md) and [system administrators](../documentation/system_administrators/system_administrators.md).
