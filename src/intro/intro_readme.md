# ThreeFold Manual

*Welcome to the ThreeFold Manual!*

This manual is organized in two main sections: 

- [ThreeFold Knowledge Base](../knowledge_base/knowledge_base.md)
- [ThreeFold Documentation](../documentation/documentation.md)

The *ThreeFold Knowledge Base* section contains all information needed to understand how the whole ThreeFold ecosystem works. 

The *ThreeFold Documentation* section contains all the practical information of the ThreeFold Grid, from general information covering the multi-functional [ThreeFold Dashboard](../documentation/dashboard/dashboard.md), the versatile [ThreeFold Connect app](../documentation/tfconnect/tfconnect_toc.md) and [TFT](../documentation/threefold_token/threefold_token.md), to specific tutorials for [developers](../documentation/developers/developers.md), [farmers](../documentation/farmers/farmers.md) and [system administrators](../documentation/system_administrators/system_administrators.md).

## Get Started

It's easy to get started on the TFGrid. 

If you want to farm TFT, check out [how to build a 3Node](../documentation/farmers/3node_building/3node_building.md). 

If you want to deploy or develop on the grid, you will first need to get TFT on TFChain:

- [Create a TFChain account](../documentation/dashboard/wallet_connector.md)
- Get TFT in your TFChain account
  - [Buy TFT](../documentation/threefold_token/buy_sell_tft/buy_sell_tft.md)
  - [Send TFT to TFChain](../documentation/threefold_token/tft_bridges/tft_bridges.md)

To develop on the Grid, read the [developers documentation](../documentation/developers/developers.md).

To deploy applications, read the [deploy section](../documentation/dashboard/deploy/deploy.md) then [access the deployment via SSH](../documentation/system_administrators/getstarted/ssh_guide/ssh_guide.md).

To learn about the ThreeFold Grid V4, have a look at [this website](https://docs.threefold.info/).
