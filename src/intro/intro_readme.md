*Welcome to the ThreeFold Knowledge Base!*

This documentation is organized in two main sections: 

- [The ThreeFold Library](../library/library.md)
- [The ThreeFold Manual](../manual/manual.md)

The ThreeFold Library contains all information needed to understand how the whole ThreeFold ecosystem works. 

The ThreeFold Manual contains all the practical information for [farmers](../farmers/farmers.md), [developers](../developers/developers.md) and [system administrators](../system_administrators/system_administrators.md).
