## Maximum Supply

The maximum amount of tokens is 4 billion, but its very unlikely we ever get there because of our burning process and recent decision to stop minting TFT. [Read more about this here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/december-22-2023-update-from-the-team/4170).

## Proof-of-Capacity

ThreeFold uses proof-of-capacity to mint tokens. Since the genenis pool, all tokens that are being minted are the result of farming.

## Proof-of-Utilization

TFT is used on the TFGrid to purchase network, compute and storage resources through the proof-of-utilization protocol.
