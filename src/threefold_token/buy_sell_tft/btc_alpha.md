To enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your BTC-Alpha account, follow these steps:

Install either the [2FA Alp Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alp.two_fa) or [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US) app on your mobile phone. You can find Authy on the App Store or Google Play, and Google Authenticator on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

Once you have installed the app, log in to your BTC-Alpha account.

Right-Click on your name or profile icon located at the top-right corner of the website to access the account settings, and look for the option "**Enable Two-factor Authentication**" and click on it.

Follow the instructions provided to link your BTC-Alpha account with the Authy or Google Authenticator app. This usually involves scanning a QR code or manually entering a code provided by the app.

Once the link is established, the app will start generating unique codes that you will need to enter during the login process for additional security.

By enabling two-factor authentication, you add an extra layer of security to your BTC-Alpha account, helping to protect your funds and personal information. Make sure to keep your mobile device with the authenticator app secure, as it will be required each time you log in to your BTC-Alpha account.

To begin trading and acquiring TFT on the BTC-Alpha exchange, you will first need to deposit funds into your account. The specific token you choose to deposit will depend on your preference and the available options on the exchange.

Search for "**BTC**" or "Bitcoin" in the list of available cryptocurrencies.

Use your personal external BTC wallet or the wallet of another exchange to initiate a withdrawal to the provided deposit address.
Ensure that you specify the correct deposit address and double-check it before confirming the transaction.

Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Bitcoin network. This may take some time depending on network congestion.
Once the transaction is confirmed, the BTC will be credited to your BTC-Alpha account balance.

You can check your account balance by clicking on the "**Wallets**" tab or by navigating to the "**Balances**" section.

Please note that the exact steps for depositing BTC may vary depending on the specific wallet or exchange you are using to send the funds. It is essential to double-check the deposit address and follow the instructions provided by your wallet or exchange to ensure a successful deposit.

### Important Notice

While it is possible to keep your TFT in your exchange wallet on BTC-Alpha, it is generally not recommended to store your funds there for an extended period. Public exchanges are more susceptible to security breaches and hacking attempts compared to personal wallets.

To ensure the safety and security of your TFT holdings, it is advisable to transfer them to a dedicated TFT wallet. There are several options available for creating a TFT wallet, each with its own unique features and benefits.

To explore different TFT wallet options and choose the one that best suits your needs, you can refer to our comprehensive [**TFT Wallet guide**](../storing_tft/storing_tft.md) that provides a list of recommended TFT wallets. This guide will help you understand the features, security measures, and compatibility of each wallet, enabling you to make an informed decision on where to store your TFT securely.

Remember, maintaining control over your private keys and taking precautions to protect your wallet information are essential for safeguarding your TFT investments.
