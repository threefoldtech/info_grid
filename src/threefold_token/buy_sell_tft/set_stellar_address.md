## How to set up a Stellar address for TFT transactions
***
In general, to set up a Stellar address to transact TFT on Stellar chain, you can use any Stellar wallet that has a TFT trustline enabled. Note that on Stellar chain, fees are paid in XLM. 

The easiest way is to simply create an account on the ThreeFold Connect App (for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threefold-connect/id1459845885)) and to then use the TFT wallet of the app, which has by default a TFT trustline on Stellar chain and also comes with 1 XLM sponsored by Threefold for transaction fees.
