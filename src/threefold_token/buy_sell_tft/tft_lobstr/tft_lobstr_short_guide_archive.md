## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of getting TFT on the [Lobstr Wallet](https://lobstr.co/). The wallet is available for both desktop and mobile as a web and mobile app.

Lobstr Wallet is a secure and user-friendly wallet designed specifically for the Stellar blockchain. It allows you to store, manage, and transact with your Stellar-based assets, including TFT (ThreeFold Token). 

## Prerequisites

- **XLM**: When getting TFT tokens using the Lobstr wallet, the process involves swapping XLM (Stellar Lumens) or other Stellar tokens into TFT. Please note that a certain amount of XLM funding is required to facilitate the sending and receiving of assets on the Stellar network.

- **Create a Lobstr Wallet and Add TFT Asset**: Create a [Lobstr Wallet](https://lobstr.co/) account via the mobile app or desktop, and [add TFT as an asset](https://lobstr.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/151000001061-adding-custom-assets-on-lobstr) (with either the code `TFT` or the home domain `threefold.io`).
