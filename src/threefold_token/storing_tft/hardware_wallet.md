## Introduction

Instead of using the ThreeFold Connect app to receive your farming rewards (TFTs), you can also have your farming rewards sent to a hardware wallet. In this case, you will need to enable a TFT trustline to receive TFT. 

You can use any hardware wallet that supports the Stellar Blockchain, such as a [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/).

## Setting up a TFT Trustline on Stellar Blockchain

Setting up a trustline is simple.

We will show an example with a Ledger hardware wallet. The process is similar with other hardware wallets. Just make sure that your hardware wallet is compatible with the Stellar blockchain, as the TFT from farming rewards will be sent on the Stellar Blockchain.

***

* First, [download Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download) and download the Stellar application in **Manager**.
* Go on an official Stellar website such as [Stellarterm](https://stellarterm.com/) or [StellarX](https://www.stellarx.com/). For this example, we will be using Stellarterm.com.

* Unlock your Ledger by entering your password.

* Select the Stellar App.
  * In our case, we do not need to create an account on Stellerterm, since we are using a hardware wallet.

* On Stellarterm.com, click on the button **LOGIN**.
