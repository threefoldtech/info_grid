## Introduction

In this section, we present different ways to store ThreeFold tokens.

The simplest way is to use the ThreeFold Connect app to store your TFT. You can also use a hardware wallet for additional security.

There are various options available to store TFTs, each with its own benefits and considerations. When it comes to storing TFTs (ThreeFold Tokens), users have the flexibility to choose between different wallet options depending on the blockchain platform on which the tokens are issued. 

If TFTs are issued on the Stellar blockchain, users can opt to store them in Stellar-compatible wallets. On the other hand, if TFTs are bridged and swapped from Stellar to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or Ethereum Network, users can utilize BSC-compatible and ETH- compatible wallets to store their tokens.
