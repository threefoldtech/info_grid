**Secure Your Account**: Set up two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security to your BTC-Alpha account. This typically involves linking your account to a 2FA app, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, and enabling it for login and transaction verification.

To enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your BTC-Alpha account, follow these steps:

Install either the [2FA Alp Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alp.two_fa) or [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US) app on your mobile phone. You can find Authy on the App Store or Google Play, and Google Authenticator on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

Once you have installed the app, log in to your BTC-Alpha account.

Right-Click on your name or profile icon located at the top-right corner of the website to access the account settings, and look for the option "**Enable Two-factor Authentication**" and click on it.

You will be provided with a TFT deposit address.
Make sure you choose **ThreeFold Token (Stellar)** as your deposit method.

To deposit, Copy this address or scan the QR code associated with it. As well as the Memo.

Use your personal external TFT wallet or the wallet of another exchange to initiate a withdrawal to the provided deposit address.

Ensure that you specify the correct deposit address and Memo. Double-check it before confirming the transaction.

**IMPORTANT**: It is crucial to always include the correct memo when sending TFT (Stellar) tokens to ensure the transaction is processed accurately. Failing to include the memo or entering an incorrect memo can lead to the loss of TFT tokens.

### Important Notice

While it is possible to keep your TFT in your exchange wallet on BTC-Alpha, it is generally not recommended to store your funds there for an extended period. Public exchanges are more susceptible to security breaches and hacking attempts compared to personal wallets.

To ensure the safety and security of your TFT holdings, it is advisable to transfer them to a dedicated TFT wallet. There are several options available for creating a TFT wallet, each with its own unique features and benefits.
