## Prerequisites

- **XLM**: When storing TFT tokens using the Albedo wallet, a certain amount of XLM funding is required to facilitate the sending and receiving of assets on the Stellar network.

There are multiple ways to acquire XLM and send it to your wallet. One option is to utilize XLM-supported exchanges, which provide a convenient platform for purchasing XLM. Click [here](https://www.coinlore.com/coin/stellar/exchanges) to access a comprehensive list of exchanges that support XLM.

As an example, we have created a tutorial specifically focusing on how to buy XLM on Coinbase, one of the popular cryptocurrency exchanges. This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on the process of purchasing XLM on **Coinbase Exchange**. You can find the tutorial [**here**](../buy_sell_tft/coinbase_xlm.md).

### Add TFT asset to Albedo Wallet

To store TFT in our Albedo Wallet, we will need to have a TFT wallet added into our account. This is done by  creating a trustline for TFT. Creating a trustline means granting permission for your Albedo wallet to recognize and interact with TFT tokens on the Stellar network. It allows you to view your TFT balance, send and receive TFT tokens, and engage in swapping or trading activities involving TFT within the Albedo wallet.

To add a trustline, go to the “**Balance**” section, and click “**Add trustline**” button.

A popup window will appear presenting Albedo's asset list. In the search field that appears, type in '**TFT**' as the asset you want to add.

**It is important to ensure that you also see the name "threefold.io" next to the logo** , as this verifies that you are selecting the genuine TFT asset associated with ThreeFold. **Beware of imposters or fraudulent assets that may attempt to mimic TFT.** ThreeFold cannot assume responsibility for any errors or mistakes made during the trustline creation process done by users. If you have any uncertainties or doubts, it is always recommended to seek assistance from official support channels or trusted sources to ensure the accuracy of the trustline configuration.

You can also transfer TFT to another stellar wallet by clicking the '**Transfer**' icon on your wallet navbar and specify the amount of TFT and the receipient's wallet address and memo (if any), and click 'Transfer' button to finish the transaction.
