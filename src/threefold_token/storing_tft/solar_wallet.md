## Prerequisites

- **XLM**: When storing TFT tokens using the Solar wallet, a certain amount of XLM funding is required to facilitate the sending and receiving of assets on the Stellar network.

There are multiple ways to acquire XLM and send it to your wallet. One option is to utilize XLM-supported exchanges, which provide a convenient platform for purchasing XLM. Click [**here**](https://www.coinlore.com/coin/stellar/exchanges) to access a comprehensive list of exchanges that support XLM.

As an example, we have created a tutorial specifically focusing on how to buy XLM on Coinbase, one of the popular cryptocurrency exchanges. This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on the process of purchasing XLM on **Coinbase Exchange**. You can find the tutorial [**here**](../buy_sell_tft/coinbase_xlm.md).

Note: It is essential to save your secret key securely during the process of creating a new account or importing an existing one. The secret key is a critical component that grants access to your wallet and funds. Make sure to store it in a safe and offline location, such as a password manager or a physical backup, to prevent unauthorized access. Do not share your secret key with anyone and exercise caution to protect your assets.

### Fund XLM to New Wallet

To initiate the process of storing TFT in Solar, the first step is to fund your wallet with XLM (Stellar Lumens). By funding your wallet with XLM, you will have the necessary cryptocurrency to cover future transaction fees and engage in token transaction activities on Solar Wallet. Follow these steps:

On the Solar Wallet homepage, click on the '**Receive**' button. This will provide you with a wallet address to receive XLM.

Copy the generated wallet address or use the provided QR code to receive XLM from your preferred source. You can use an external exchange, another wallet, or any platform that supports XLM transfers.

Send the desired amount of XLM to the generated wallet address. Ensure that you are sending XLM from a compatible source, and double-check the address to prevent any errors. Wait for the XLM transaction to be confirmed on the Stellar network. This typically takes a few moments, but it may vary depending on network congestion.

Once XLM is successfuly sent, it will appear on your Solar homepage.

### Adding TFT Asset to Solar Wallet

To store TFT in our Solar Wallet, we will need to have a TFT wallet added into our account. This is done by  adding TFT Asset. This will allow you to view your TFT balance, send and receive TFT tokens, and engage in trading activities involving TFT within the Solar wallet.

To add the TFT (ThreeFold Token) asset to your Solar Wallet account, follow these steps:

Click on the top-right menu icon in your Solar Wallet interface. This will open a dropdown menu with various options. From the dropdown menu, select "**Assets & Balances.**" This will navigate you to the Assets & Balances section of your wallet.

**IMPORTANT**: It is important to ensure that you also see the name "**threefold.io**" next to the logo , as this verifies that you are selecting the genuine TFT asset associated with ThreeFold. **Beware of imposters or fraudulent assets that may attempt to mimic TFT.** ThreeFold cannot assume responsibility for any errors or mistakes made during the trustline creation process done by users. If you have any uncertainties or doubts, it is always recommended to seek assistance from official support channels or trusted sources to ensure the accuracy of the trustline configuration.

Once you see the TFT asset, click on the "**Add Asset To Account**" button. Please note that adding the asset will require a small amount of XLM to set up a trustline for the TFT asset.
