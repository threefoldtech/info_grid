## ThreeFold Connect Installation

Either use the links above, or search for the ThreeFold Connect App on the Apple Store or the Google Play store. Then install and open the app. If you want to leave a 5 star review of the App, no one here will stop you!

![farming_tf_wallet_1](./img/farming_tf_wallet_1.png)
![farming_tf_wallet_2](./img/farming_tf_wallet_2.png)

When you try to open the App, if you get an error message such as : "Error in initialization in Flagsmith...", you might need to upgrade your phone to a newer software version (8.0 for Android and 13 for iOS).

Once you are in the application, you will see some introduction pages to help you familiarize with the TF Connect App. You will also be asked to read and accept ThreeFold's Terms and conditions.

![farming_tf_wallet_3](./img/farming_tf_wallet_3.png)
![farming_tf_wallet_4](./img/farming_tf_wallet_4.png)

You will then be asked to either *SIGN UP* or *RECOVER ACCOUNT*. For now, we will show how to sign up. Later in the guide, we will show you how to recover an account.

![farming_tf_wallet_5](./img/farming_tf_wallet_5.png)

You will then be asked to choose a *Threefold Connect Id*. This ID will be used, as well as the seed phrase, when you want to recover an account. Choose wisely. And do not forget it! Here we will use TFExample, as an example.

![farming_tf_wallet_6](./img/farming_tf_wallet_6.png)

Next, you need to add a valid email address. This will be used as a broad KYC. You will need to access your email and confirm the validation email from ThreeFold to use properly the TF Connect App Wallet.

![farming_tf_wallet_7](./img/farming_tf_wallet_7.png)

Then, the next step is crucial! Make sure no one is around looking at your screen. You will be shown your seed phrase. Keep this in a secure and offline place. You will need the 3bot ID and the seed phrase to recover your account. This seed phrase is of utmost important. Do not lose it nor give it to anyone.

![farming_tf_wallet_8](./img/farming_tf_wallet_8.png)

Once you've hit Next, you will be asked to write down 3 random words of your seed phrase. This is a necessary step to ensure you have taken the time to write down your seed phrase.

![farming_tf_wallet_9](./img/farming_tf_wallet_9.png)

Then, you'll be asked to confirm your TF 3bot name and the associated email.

![farming_tf_wallet_10](./img/farming_tf_wallet_10.png)

Finally, you will be asked to choose a 4-digit pin. This will be needed to use the ThreeFold Connect App. If you ever forget this 4-digit pin, you will need to recover your account from your 3bot name and your seed phrase. You will need to confirm the new pin in the next step.

![farming_tf_wallet_11](./img/farming_tf_wallet_11.png)

That's it! You've created your ThreeFold Connect account. You can press the hamburger menu on the top left to explore the ThreeFold Connect App.

![farming_tf_wallet_12](./img/farming_tf_wallet_12.png)

In the next step, we will create a ThreeFold Connect Wallet. You'll see, it's very simple!

In this email, click on the link *Verify my email address*. This will lead you to a *login.threefold.me* link. The process should be automatic. Once this is done, you will receive a confirmation on screen, as well as on your phone.

![farming_tf_wallet_40](./img/farming_tf_wallet_40.png)

If for some reason, you did not receive the verification email, simply click on *Verify* and another email will be sent.

## Send and Receive TFT between TF Connect Wallets

To send and receive TFT between TF Connect Wallet, go into Wallet and select the wallet you want to use.Remember that you must always send and receive TFT on the same chain, so choose either Stellar or TFChain.
***
### Send TFT
***
To send tokens, select *Send Coins* in the wallet section. To send TFT, you can scan the QR code of the address you wish to send tokens to. This will enter automatically the necessary information. Make sure to double check that the information is correct to avoid any complications. Otherwise, you can simply enter the correct address in the section *To*. Choose the amount you want to send. Then click on *SEND TOKENS*. 

Note that, for such transactions, there is a maximum fee of 0.10 TFT on the Stellar blockchain, and a maximum fee of 0.01 TFT on the TFChain. This amount is taken from the amount you are sending. It is not taken directly in your wallet. 
***
### Receive TFT
***
To receive tokens, select *Receive Coins* in the wallet section. To receive TFT, you can generate a QR code to share to the person waiting to send you tokens. Otherwise, the sender can simply use your Stellar or TFChain address and send you TFT.

To generate the QR Code, select the chain you want to use, Stellar or TFChain, enter the amount and the message if needed and click on *GENERATE QR CODE*. Note that there is no message option for TFChain, only for Stellar. This will generate a QR Code that can be scanned by other devices.
