# Mastodon Servers: FAQ

- **What do I need to get started?**
You only need a TFT wallet and some TFTs to get started. TFTs are needed to fund the deployment. We recommend you to use **TF Connect App** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) / [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threefold-connect/id1459845885). Please download TF Connect App before you proceed.

- **How can I buy TFTs?**
You can buy TFTs in numerous ways, for example via decentralized exchangers, farmers, and many more. Read the complete list of TFT vendors and how to buy TFT [**here**](../concepts/buying_storing_tft.md).

- **What happens if I forget my Mnenomic?**
Unfortunately, since our deployment account system is truly decentralized, we would not be able to assist you to log into your account without Mnemonic. **Please keep a copy of your mnemonic safe.** This would be the only way to recover your instance in the future. Failure to do so will result in a loss of account.

- **Can I deploy multiple Mastodon servers on the same deployment account?**
Yes, you can! You can manage all your mastodon servers on the 'Deployment List' section of your account. 

- **What's The difference for me as a user to build a mastodon server on certified node vs DIY node?**
Building Mastodon Servers using Certified Nodes mean that you are building your server on top of ThreeFold's nodes that farmers bought from ThreeFold Certified Nodes partners, instead of DIY Nodes (Nodes that farmers build themselves).

- - **What does exactly 'Enable TF Connect' on the 'basic'deployment setting mean?**
In means once you have activated your Mastodon servers, you have the option of letting users of your server to create or login to their Mastodon account quickly by using TF Connect App login.

- **What does exactly 'locked balance' on my account mean?**
Locked Balance means the balance, or the amount of topped up TFT in your deployment wallet that has already been reserved and allocated for your active deployed servers. Each server that you have deployed and activated will need to be funded daily, and the locked balance make sure that your server will be up and running.

- **What happens if I forgot to fund my mastodon server?**
If your account is running out of balance, your mastodon server will be temporarily deactivated until you top up your account again, the server will not be deleted. You will be given a grace period of two weeks to top up your balance and reactivate your server. [Click here for more detailed information about Grace Period.](../concepts/contract_grace_period.md)

- **How will I know if my account is running out of balance?**
Your deployment wallet will always display how much TFT is left on your account.

- **I accidentally deleted my Mastodon Server, can I get it back?**
Unfortunately once deleted, you won't be able to retract your old server back. That is why we always ask you to confirm upon server deletion everytime.
