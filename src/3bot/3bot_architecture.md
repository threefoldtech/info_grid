## ThreeFold Architecture and 3Bots

The ThreeFold Grid is the co-owned infrastructure layer, and can be seen as a decentralized cloud. Farmers provide storage, compute, and network capacity to the people around them and earn for it. Farmers can be commercial entities or anyone using our open-source software to deploy nodes in their homes, schools and offices.

3Bots live on top of the ThreeFold Grid and act as Web2 and Web3 gateways as well as self-healing bots for IT workloads. They are private virtual assistants that help users achieve a convenient, secure, and authentic digital life. They assist Web3 developers in achieving quicker results by alleviating concerns related to decentralization, scalability, storage stability, and performance, among other things.

3Bots communicate directly with each other and the rest of the world (existing centralized services) as well as existing blockchain technologies. The data is stored using a novel storage technology which makes sure it is safe and can never get lost, yet it is only owned by you and not even a quantum computer can hack it.

## 3Bot and Web Apps

More or less any application which runs in centralized data centers can be migrated to run on our decentralized Internet. As long as the application can run on Linux, it can run on the ThreeFold Grid.

For developers, the 3Bot is very valuable since any Web3 experience can be created faster, more private and decentralized. For system administrators, any app which runs on Linux can run on the 3Nodes which use Zero-OS. 3Bots can communicate easily with both the Web2 and Web3 layers.

For projects which are ready to step in the future, they can modify their web application to use the 3Bot backend, which provides huge benefits to do with security, energy efficiency, sovereignty, and also ease of use. The current Internet requires us to be experts in how we need to use all these different apps, it is just not logical.
