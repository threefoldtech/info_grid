## Personal Gateways to the Web3 World

We imagine a future where every user can have their own 3Bot serving as a personal gateway to their decentralized web3 universe. This 3Bot functions as your virtual assistant, simplifying your digital life. Indeed, the 3Bot literally acts as a personal gateway to the Web3 world. 

Currently, developing for Web3 requires significant expertise. Developers typically need access to API gateways, which are often supplied by commercial companies. They must familiarize themselves with a variety of blockchain technologies and different types of interfaces before they can produce good results. The 3Bot allows the developer to interact with one high-level simple interface. 

Moreover, the 3Bot will further communicate with different Blockchain Networks and Technologies as well as the older Web2 protocols like smtp, imap, webdav, caldav, carddav, ftp, etc. The 3Bot will also make sure that the data of users can never get corrupted nor lost.

In this architecture, every person owns a 3Bot. This gives ultimate scalability and flexibility. Development time can be reduced by at least a factor of 3, while maintaining 100% compatibility with the existing Internet and Web3 world.

## 3Bot Complements Web3

Thanks to many features of the 3Bots, this technology complements very well the Web3 world. 3Bots resolve bottlenecks, improve storage efficiency, privacy and reliability. It can also store petabytes of information while never getting corrupted.

The 3bots allow for personal private gateways to many Web3 protocols and services as well as seamless integration with smart contracts. It uses private sandboxes and can do transactions off-chain, which makes it super safe. 

3Bots can be coded with Vlang, which is efficient and highly flexible.

3Bots allow for seamless deployments of any blockchain or Web3 component. Thanks to the integration of 3Bots with 3Nodes, any validator or other Web3 component can be deployed in minutes in all privacy and security with no scalability limitations.

## GDPR Compliant by Design

3Bots easily resolve the sovereignty issue. By design, 3Bots are compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) since the data is owned by users and that all data, even blockchain data, can be within a specific country. Full privacy and GDPR compliance go hand in hand with 3Bots.

## Ease of Development

3Bots are compatible with full JSON RPC API as well as its own efficient Vlang language. Domain specific language (DSL) allows people to develop complicated flows in a short period of time. 3Bots allow offer integrated chat bot functionalities.
