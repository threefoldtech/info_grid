## What is ThreeFold?

ThreeFold provides a new way to deploy Internet capacity (storage, compute and network). Internet capacity providers, called farmers, deploy capacity, and developers use this capacity. 

Any computer can become a 3Node and run our bare-metal operating system, called Zero-OS. Not only this, but a 3Node comes with our quantum safe storage system. Composed of 3Nodes, the ThreeFold Grid (TFGrid) thus provides secure and reliable compute, storage and network units. Applications can be deployed on this network of capacity in neutrality and with data sovereignty. 

The aim of the ThreeFold project is to provide an alternative Internet experience. Here are some of its benefits:

- Green = up to 100x energy savings (by using the 3Bot concept).
- Neutral Search = find and publish all information without manipulation.
- Help bring the Internet to the 3 billion people who don’t have reasonable access yet.
- Allow everyone to build on top (open source), equality is important.
- Give everyone their personal 3Bot to make the Internet more easy and safe to use without the need for manipulation and addictions. The Internet should be a tool, not take over our life.

## What is a 3Bot?

A 3Bot is a personal digital private assistant and gateway to the Web2 and Web3 worlds that helps you organize your Internet Life.

The 3Bot helps you to manage your calendar, personal data and files, personal communication, digital money, to deploy required solutions or applications on top of the TFGrid, to participate in the DAO, to communicate in an easy and uniform way to the Web2 and Web3 worlds, and so much more.

The 3Bot is like a virtual service assistant, i.e. an intelligent digital avatar, which assists a person or a group of people, running in a ThreeFold Container. The 3Bot is a secure personal virtual systems administrator and data, communications and transactions manager. It acts as your online guardian that keeps you safe when doing online activities.

3Bots manage and enable both the [ThreeFold](http://threefold.io/) and [FreeFlow](https://freeflow.life/) ecosystems. To function properly and remain active on the TFGrid, each 3Bot requires capacity on the TFGrid and thus ThreeFold Tokens (TFT). This project is one of the major use cases on the TFGrid and it’s a non-profit initiative.

The 3Bot technology also uses VLang, the 3Bot developer-friendly language. This language, which has more than 25K stars on Github, is a simple language for building maintainable programs.

## What a 3Bot Can Do

We present here a few of the many capabilities the 3Bot offers:

- Your personal gateway to the Ethereum and wider web3 ecosystems.
- Your personal fully integrated BTC and BTC Lightning Node with extra tools.
- A chat interface to communicate with your 3Bot as well as Nostr & Matrix users.
- A personal data store for all your apps, which can scale to petabytes, is 100% private and unbreakable. 
- Deploy block chain nodes or any other decentralized application on top of the TFGrid, directly integrated with your 3Bot. You only need JSON-RPC to communicate with your apps. 
- Chat Bot Framework and DSL for all Clients in Vlang (25.000 github stars).
- Personal VPN service (WireGuard and Yggdrasil).
- Manage your 3Nodes, the nodes making up the TFGrid.
- Quantum Safe Storage System, WebDav, IPFS and more.

## Ideal for Developers

> Are You a Developer?

You will love to develop on top of a 3Bot. You can use any language to program against a 3Bot.
Your developed applications will be made available to the 3Bot Community.
We even have our own language called Vlang, which is like a simple and more efficient version of Go. You can extend the 3Bot using Vlang. We have DSL (Domain Specific Language) features for all our interfaces in Vlang.

Any Digital Experience can be built on top of a 3Bot, and the 3Bot can communicate with many Web2 or Web3 protocols.
