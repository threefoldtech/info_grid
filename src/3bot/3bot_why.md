## Introduction

The 3Bot answers fundamental questions in the IT world. It provides safety in storage thanks to its quantum safe filesystem. It also offers next to unlimited scalability and high energy efficiency thanks to its unique design.

With 3Bots, you can integrate easily with the Web3 world: every language can be used with the 3bot and it is compatible with all the major blockchains.

## A New Paradigm: Total Security and Flexibility

3Bots are personal gateways providing access to the decentralized web3 universe while also making sure that the data of users can never get corrupted nor lost.

The human tendency to prioritize centralization and control has led to suboptimal and less efficient systems which unnecessarily generate excessive waste. Web 1, 2 , 3, and 4 are all centralized by nature. The solution is actually very simple. You should be the center of your digital life. You should own all your data. You should be your own application (we call this 3Bot). We believe +90% of your digital needs can be implemented this way. Blockchain technology is necessary for items where consensus is required like identity, money, and smart contracts.

There is a need for a co-owned global Internet infrastructure on top of which each of us can exist digitally. This is a dramatically different architecture that offers a major focus on decentralization, full data and application ownership as well as 100% equality. ThreeFold is building such an Internet, a complementary Internet that is co-owned, sovereign, secure, cost-effective, and available worldwide. The project consists of two main layers: the capacity layer, which is a network of 3Nodes (servers), and the 3Bots layer.

## 3Bot Technology

Each 3Bot is hosted on the ThreeFold Grid. The data is using the quantum safe storage layer and can never be corrupted nor lost. This architecture is super scalable where billions of 3Bots can be deployed.

Thanks to the 3Bot technology, your digital life is 100% owned by you and no one else. This is partly due to the peer-to-peer encrypted communication of the 3Bots which can scale endlessly. You have 100% control over where the data is, who can access it and what is being kept or deleted. 3Bots can communicate to one another directly and they can also communicate with any blockchain technology.

Any existing web framework can be used to create the experiences.

The 3Bot technology also makes use of the zero-knowledge quantum safe storage system which is 100% private per instance and where storage is distributed over multiple 3Nodes. Each 3Bot goes through quantum safe storage system layered by the 3Nodes, the latter which provide compute, storage and network units.

Each 3Bot talks directly to the other 3Bots using a shortest path performer to increase efficiency. This keeps information flow local and provides for a greener Internet experience. It also improves security, performance and privacy. The communication between 3Bots do not require any SSL key exchange.

The 3Bot technology provides ultra reliable and scalable storage for your data which is stored in a quantum safe way on top of the ThreeFold Grid.

The 3Bot is also compatible with IPFS to integrate with the web3 world. It also offers genuine decentralized alternatives to many of the most used apps out there: Zoom, Whatsapp, Facebook, Google, etc.

Each 3Bot can talk to any blockchain to arrange management of digital currencies and peer2peer exchange of value. The 3Bots are thus compatible with any major blockchain technology. You can integrate 3Bots with blockchains to settle smart contracts, identity and digital money. 3Bots and Web3 are a perfect combination allowing for an enhance web experience.

The 3Bots can also talk to web 2 applications and own deployed client-server applications on top of the TFGrid. This leads to a super scalable and polyvalent ecosystem.
