### What is a 3Bot?

3Bots are personal gateways providing access to the decentralized web3 universe while also making sure that the data of users can never get corrupted nor lost.

A 3Bot is also a personal digital private assistant to help you organize your Internet Life.

The 3Bot helps you to manage your calendar, personal data and files, personal communication, digital money, to deploy required solutions or applications on top of the TFGrid, to participate in the DAO, to communicate in an easy and uniform way to the WEB2 and WEB3 world, and so much more

***

### What can a 3Bot do?

Here are a few of the many capabilities the 3Bot offers:

Your personal gateway to the Ethereum and wider web3 ecosystems.
Your personal fully integrated BTC and BTC Lightning Node with extra tools.
A chat interface to communicate with your 3Bot as well as Nostr & Matrix users.
A personal data store for all your apps, which can scale to petabytes, is 100% private and unbreakable.
Deploy block chain nodes or any other decentralized application on top of the TFGrid, directly integrated with your 3Bot. You only need JSON-RPC to communicate with your apps.
Chat Bot Framework and DSL for all Clients in Vlang (25.000 github stars).
Personal VPN service (WireGuard and Yggdrasil).
Manage your 3Nodes, the nodes making up the TFGrid.
Quantum Safe Storage System, WebDav, IPFS and more.

***

### What programming language can I use with a 3Bot?

You can use any language to program against a 3Bot. Your developed applications will be made available to the 3Bot Community. We even have our own language called Vlang, which is like a simple and more efficient version of Go. You can extend the 3Bot using Vlang. We have DSL (Domain Specific Language) features for all our interfaces in Vlang.

***

### How scalable are 3Bots?

The 3Bot architecture is super scalable where billions of 3Bots can be deployed.

***

### Why are 3Bot green and energy-efficient?

Each 3Bot talks directly to the other 3Bots. This keeps information flow local and provides for a greener Internet experience. It also improves security, performance and privacy.

***

### Can data on a 3Bot be corrupted or lost?

No, data on a 3Bot cannot be corrupted. 

Each 3Bot is hosted on the ThreeFold Grid. The data is using the quantum safe storage layer and thus can never be corrupted nor lost. 

***

### Is the 3Bot technology compatible with IPFS?

Yes, the 3Bot is also compatible with IPFS to integrate with the web3 world.

***

### Is the 3Bot technology only for Web3?

No, the 3Bot technology is compatible with Web2 applications, client-server applications and also Web3 applications.

***

### Is the 3Bot technology compatible with major blockchains?

Each 3Bot can talk to any blockchain around (web3) to arrange management of digital currencies and peer2peer exchange of value. The 3Bots are compatible with any major blockchain technology.

***

### How are prices managed with the 3Bot?

The basic pricing for the services (compute, storage and network) are defined by the DAO, while the Commercial Service Level Fees are specified by the farmer.

***

### How can users use the 3Bot? What are the mechanisms for 3Bot utilization?

Users of the ThreeFold Grid need to spend CHI to reserve and/or use the TFGrid range of services. A user will use his/her 3Bot to use the services provided on the TFGrid.

The user's 3Bot can query the TFChain and the TFGrid Universe to find the required IT capacity providing services based on the following criteria:

- Reputation of farmer
- Whether the farmer is commercial (see above) or not
- Pricing of the IT capacity
- Components inside the nodes (type of CPU, GPU, amount of SSD, …)
- Network connectivity (performance)
- Location (country, region, …)
- Service levels provided (e.g. a user can specify that they want to achieve 99,9% uptime)
