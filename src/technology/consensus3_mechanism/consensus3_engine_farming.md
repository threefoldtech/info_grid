### consensus engine in relation to TFT Farming Rewards in TFGrid 3.0

!!!include:consensus3_overview_graph

The consensus engine checks the farming rules as defined in 

- [farming logic 3.0](farming_reward)
- [farming reward calculator](farming_calculator)

- if uptime + 98% per month then the TFT will be rewarded to the farmer (for TFGrid 3.0, can change later).

All the data of the farmer and the 3nodes are registered on TFChain
