### 3Bot

3Bot is a virtual system administrator that manages the user's IT workloads under a private key. This ensures an immutable record of any workload as well as a self-healing functionality to restore these workloads if/when needed. Also, all 3Bot IDs are registered on a modern type of phone book that uses blockchain technology. This phone book, also referred to as the Threefold Grid Blockchain, allows all 3Bots to find each other, connect and exchange information or resources in a fully end-to-end encrypted way. Here as well, there are "zero people involved, as 3Bots operate autonomously in the network, and only under the user's commands.Â 

3Bot is equipped with a cryptographic 2-factor authentication mechanism. You can log in to your 3Bot via the ThreeFold Connect app on your device which contains your private key. The 3Bot is a very powerful tool that allows you to automate & manage thousands of virtual workloads on the ThreeFold_Grid.
