## Unbreakable Storage

- Unlimited history
- Survives network, datacenter or node breakdown
- No silent corruption possible
- Quantum safe (data cannot be decrypted by quantum computers) as long as quantum computer has no access to the metadata
- Self-healing & autocorrecting


If you deploy a container with simple disk access, you donâ€™t have it. 
Performance is around 50MB/second, if a bit more CPU is given for the distributed storage encoder, we achieve this performance.
