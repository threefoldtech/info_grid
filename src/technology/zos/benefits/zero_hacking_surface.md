## Zero Hacking Surface

Zero does not mean is not possible but we use this term to specificy that we minized the attack surface for hackers.

- There is no shell/server interface on zero-os level (our operating system)
- There are no hidden or unintended processes running which are not prevalidatedOne comment: still ssh server running with keys of a few people on each server, not yet disabled. To be disabled in the near future, now still useful to debug but it is a backdoor. The creation of a new primitive where the farmer agrees to give access to administrators under analysis. This way, when a reservation is sent to a node, a ssh server is booted up with chosen key to allow admins to go in.
