1. The Services

1.1 Generally. You may access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement. You agree to comply with the terms of this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Service Offerings.

1.2 Offerings and Access. TF Hub Limited is selling cloud IT capacity (consisting of compute, storage and network capacity) made available on the ThreeFold Grid, as further detailed on the Site. The IT capacity that is available through the ThreeFold Grid can only be purchased using ThreeFold Token (‘TFT’), the exclusive cryptocurrency of the ThreeFold Project. Each TFT thus represents a certain amount of compute, storage and network capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. On our Site, we offer you the possibility to purchase your IT Capacity on the ThreeFold Grid (the ‘Services’) by acquiring TFTs. The cryptocurrencies accepted as a payment instrument are explicitly mentioned on our Site. Services are accessed through the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Site, unless otherwise agreed in writing or otherwise offered.

1.3 Third-Party Services. When you use our Services, you may also be using the services of one or more third parties. Your use of these third party services may be subject to the separate policies, terms of use, and fees of these third parties.

1.4 By transferring a Bitcoin amount (or any other cryptocurrency amount as may be accepted by TF Hub Limited on the Site) to TF Hub Limited using the Site, you offer to purchase a certain number of TFTs, the value of which corresponds to the amount of the transferred amount. By doing so you agree to the value of the TFTs to be purchased, as these are determined and recorded by TF Hub Limited. The value of the TFTs will be recorded at the time when you have chosen a payment method and the payment has started and/or is executed, which shall correspond to the actual market value to be determined by TF Hub Limited (plus any costs of the payment service, if any). 

1.5 The TFTs purchased through the Service will be sent to the receiving address indicated by you. You declare that the specified receiving address is part of your personal wallet. You declare that no third person or legal entity has access to the wallet and that you are the owner of the wallet.

1.7 A completed payment, as well as the sending of cryptocurrencies by you to us cannot be reversed. Cryptocurrencies can never be exchanged or returned, unless otherwise provided by applicable law (see in this case section 3.5 below).
