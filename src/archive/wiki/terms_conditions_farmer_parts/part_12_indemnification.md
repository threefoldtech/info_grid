### 12. INDEMNIFICATION

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Company and our respective past, present, and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns (the "**Indemnified Parties**") from and against all claims, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that arise from or relate to: (i) your use of the Software; (ii) your participation in the ThreeFold_Grid; (iii) any Feedback you provide; or (iv) your breach of this Agreement.

Company reserves the right to exercise sole control over the defense of any claim subject to indemnification under the paragraph above, at your expense. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and Company.

If the Software becomes, or in Company’s reasonable judgment is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then Company may in its sole discretion: (a) obtain the right, for Farmer to continue using the Software; (b) provide a non-infringing functionally equivalent replacement; or (c) modify the Software so that it is no longer infringing. If Company, in its sole and reasonable judgment, determines that none of the above options are commercially reasonable, then Company may, without liability, suspend or terminate Farmer’s use of the Software. This Section 12 states Company’s sole liability and Farmer’s exclusive remedy for infringement claims.
