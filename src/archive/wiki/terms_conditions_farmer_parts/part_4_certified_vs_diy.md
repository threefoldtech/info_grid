### 4. CERTIFIED VS. DIY-FARMERS

There are two types of ThreeFold Farmers:

1. Certified Farmer: Uses hardware from certified sources and signs a contract with TF Tech NV for support and additional benefits
2. Do It Yourself (DIY) Farmer: Uses any hardware and in case of support uses online material only.

Farmers can opt in for certification ("**Certification**"). Certification can be withdrawn in case the relevant 3Node does no longer comply with the applicable certification requirements.

The following criteria or requirements are checked (timing of implementation, see roadmap on wiki):

- Bandwidth: 24 times a day random non local nodes are used to upload a 2MB file to a 3Node. The bandwidth will be measured in mbit/sec
- Utilization: Through the ThreeFold Explorer the true utilization of the 3Node will be checked. It will be displayed in % of the 3Node total capacity.
- Uptime: The uptime per month will be created in the ThreeFold Explorer and is presented as a percentage of 3Node availability.

ThreeFold Foundation or TFTech may give free certification to 3Nodes that benefit the distribution of capacity on the ThreeFold_Grid.

ThreeFold Foundation or TFTech may also certify certain hardware partners (i.e. certified hardware vendors) as part of this certification process.
