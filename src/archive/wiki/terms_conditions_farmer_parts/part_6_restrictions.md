### 6. RESTRICTIONS

You will operate the 3Node in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in no other manner. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you will not:

1. access or use the ThreeFold_Grid: (i) in violation of applicable laws; or (ii) in a manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or performance of the ThreeFold_Grid (or the data contained therein).
2. with respect to Content (i) reverse engineer any aspect of the Content or do anything that might discover the contents or origin of the Content, (ii) attempt to bypass or circumvent measures employed to prevent or limit access to the Content, including by attempting to defeat any encryption, or (iii) attempt to interfere with the storage or transmission of Content or with our audits of your 3Node(s);
3. manipulate or otherwise attempt to bypass, change, or update any values related to uptime detection outside the programmatic operation of the Software;
4. deliberately or actively limit or otherwise negatively impact download speed such that insufficient bandwidth is available for required audit traffic;
5. manipulate or alter the default behavior of the ThreeFold_Grid to artificially increase or decrease the value of any reputation factor of any 3Node;
6. manipulate network responses to any request with unauthorized intent to change the cryptographic signatures, NodeID, or TFT wallet address;
7. attempt to manipulate or falsify the identification of the 3Node by the Software or otherwise bypass the proof of capacity process;
8. retain any Content after the earlier of termination of this Agreement or de-certification of the applicable 3Node at any time; or
9. in any other way attempt to interfere, impede, alter, or otherwise interact in any manner not expressly authorized hereunder with the ThreeFold_Grid or the operation of any other 3Node(s).
