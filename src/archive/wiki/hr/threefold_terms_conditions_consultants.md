Should the transfer of moral rights be limited by law, Consultant will never seek to enforce its moral rights in a manner that would limit or damage the normal activities of The Company (or its licensees or assignees).
 
The Consultant accepts that The Company acts, as of the signing of this contract, as the exclusive representative of the Consultant for the exercise of the moral rights on the Works, such as the right of disclosure or of paternity concerning the Works.

The Company (or its licensees and assigns) can license and/or otherwise assign these rights to third parties, during this Agreement as well as after its termination.

The Consultant did not and will not introduce into the Works any element, subject, reminiscence or resemblance that the Consultant knows violates or is capable of violating the rights of a third party or legal provisions (for example, relating to public order and good morals). 

Any Work that is software did not, does not and will not contain, and is not, work based on, derived from, or created using any software created by any third party, except (i) software to and for which the Company held exclusive ownership of all rights, title and interests in and to the Intellectual Property Rights therein at the time the software was developed or otherwise created or (ii) software which has been pre-approved by the Company. 

The Consultant undertakes, at the first request and at the expense of the Company, both during the term of the contract and afterwards, to provide all necessary or useful assistance and to furnish and/or sign any document which makes possible, facilitates or accelerates the granting, the maintenance and/or the renewal of one or several Intellectual Property Rights on all or part of the Works, on behalf of the
Company or one of its affiliated companies.
The Consultant undertakes to refrain from any act which would constitute a violation of the rights of the Company. The Consultant undertakes not to apply for or claim (or to have applied for or claimed by third parties) the granting of a patent or any other intellectual property right in relation to the Works, unless it has received the express and written authorisation of the Company.

Consultant undertakes to make full and prompt disclosure, without compensation, of all relevant documents and data in favor of the consultant and to provide all necessary cooperation for (the securing of) the assignment to The Company of all patrimonial, and, to the extent permitted by the applicable law, all moral Intellectual Property Rights.
 
Consultant undertakes and guarantees that it is the current owner of the Intellectual Property Rights and that it is thus capable of transferring the Intellectual Property Rights to The Company. The Consultant further undertakes and guarantees that none of the Works violate any rights of third parties, and will indemnify The Company (or its licensees and assigns) for all claims by any third parties in this respect.
 
Consultant agrees that the fees paid by The Company to the Consultant pursuant to this Agreement constitute the entire compensation for such transfer of Intellectual Property Rights and that Consultant is not entitled to any share of the profit resulting from any possible exploitation in whatever form of the Intellectual Property Rights, or any other compensation other than that provided for in this Agreement. Should the Consultant have a legal right to compensation for a new, currently non-existent form of exploitation, then this compensation will amount to 0.1% of the net profits realized by this new form of exploitation, with an absolute overall maximum of 500 EUR for all works so exploited.

Consultant will keep confidential and not disclose to any third parties for a period of no less than ten (10) years information relating to the Works that The Company itself has not disclosed to the public without restriction.

23.	Injunctive Relief
The Consultant acknowledges that disclosure of any Confidential Information by him will give rise to irreparable injury to the Company or the owner of such information, inadequately compensable in damages. Accordingly, the Company or such other party may seek and obtain injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of the foregoing undertakings, in addition to any other legal remedies which may be available.

25.	Non Waiver 
No failure or neglect of either party hereto in any instance to exercise any right, power or privilege hereunder or under law shall constitute a waiver of any other right, power or privilege or of the same right, power or privilege in any other instance.
