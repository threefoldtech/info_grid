# Introduction: Collaboration Manifest

FreeFlow nation created this collaboration manifest which can be freely used by any organization who finds them useful. If you would like to see any changes to this document please email to **info@freeflownation.org**.
We at ThreeFold want to follow these guidelines.

This document has been created honoring the [FreeFlow Nation Manifesto](https://www.freeflownation.org/manifesto.html).

# Code of Conduct

## Forum & Chat Rules

We are committed to making participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing private information without explicit permission (e.g. physical or electronic address)

## Moderation Rights

Content moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject all posts, comments, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. They may also suspend or ban any forum member for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, moderators commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this community. Moderators who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the moderation team.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by flagging the post or comment in question. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed both necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Moderators are obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the identity of the reporting party.

The forum is a place where we bring people together that share the same values and want to make the world a better place. Positive feedback is well appreciated but must always stay respectful and helpful. Moderators thus have the right to remove any posts spreading negativity and/or attacking the project and its founders.

## Contribution

We welcome everyone to contribute and thank you for your content contribution.

Content can be chat, questions, answers, blogs, articles, knowledge base information, tutorials, …

The more people collaborate the more relevant set of information will be created.

Creating content constitutes your agreement to release submitted content as public domain ([CC0 10 4](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)).

## Keep It Simple and Relevant

Overload of information is maybe even worse as not enough information.

Please keep your discussions and contributions information-rich. If your signal-to-noise ratio gets too low, you will be muted or banned from the forum or relevant chat. This is up to the discretion of ThreeFold moderators.

## Content Verification Guidelines

We believe it’s in the best interest of our community to know the origin and authenticity of any information contributed. We want to do everything possible to verify the authenticity of the content created (e.g. messages, knowledge-base, chats, etc.). As such it’s our right to block a contributor from creating any content if identity cannot be verified.

## Freedom of Speech.

We believe in freedom of speech as long as it’s not in contradiction with our Content Verification Guidelines.

# Contribution Guidelines

## This is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion

Please treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.

These are not hard and fast rules, merely guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a clean and well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

## Improve the Discussion

Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.

One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.

## Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree

You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid any of the following:

* Name-calling
* Ad hominem attacks
* Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content
* Knee-jerk contradiction

Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

## Your Participation Counts

The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.

The forum we use (Discourse) provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.

Let’s leave our community better than we found it.

## If You See a Problem, Flag It

Moderators have special authority: they are responsible for this forum, but so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.

When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.

In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts: the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.

## Always Be Civil

Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:

* Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
* Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
* Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
* Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.

These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times.

This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.

## Keep It Tidy

Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up.

In brief:

* Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.
* Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
* Don’t post no-content replies.
* Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.
* Don’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.
* Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.

## Post Only Your Own Stuff

You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (e.g. software, video, audio, images, etc.), or for breaking any other law.

## Powered by You

This site is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in the site feedback category and let’s discuss! If there’s a critical or urgent issue that can’t be handled by a meta topic or flag, contact us via the support live chat.

## Terms of Service

Yes, legalese is boring, but we must protect ourselves – and by extension, you and your data – against unfriendly folks. We have a Terms of Service describing your (and our) behavior and rights related to content, privacy, and laws. To use this service, you must agree to abide by our TOS. See below for more information on this.

# Terms of Service (TOS)

Please read:

6. You may not use the forum to send e-mail to distribution lists, newsgroups, or group mail aliases.
7. You may not falsely imply that you’re affiliated with or endorsed by the company.

## Enforcement

The company may investigate and prosecute violations of these terms to the fullest legal extent. The company may notify and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting violations of the law and these terms.

The company reserves the right to change, redact, and delete content on the forum for any reason. If you believe someone has submitted content to the forum in violation of these terms, [contact us immediately](#contact).

## Your Account

You must create and log into an account to use some features of the forum.

To create an account, you must provide some information about yourself. If you create an account, you agree to provide, at a minimum, a valid e-mail address, and to keep that address up-to-date. You may close your account at any time by e-mailing **info@threefold.io**.

You agree to be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or notify the company that your account has been compromised. You agree to notify the company immediately if you suspect your account has been compromised. You agree to select a secure password for your account, and keep it secret.

The company may restrict, suspend, or close your account on the forum according to its policy for handling copyright-related takedown requests, or if the company reasonably believes that you’ve broken any rule in these terms.

## Your Content

Nothing in these terms gives the company any ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with the forum, such as your account information, posts, or other content you submit to the forum. Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the company’s intellectual property, either.

Between you and the company, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the forum. You agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the forum is sponsored or approved by the company. These terms do not obligate the company to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit, and to change it, according to these terms.

Content you submit to the forum belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it. But at a minimum, you license the company to provide content that you submit to the forum to other users of the forum. That special license allows the company to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the forum.

When content you submit is removed from the forum, whether by you or by the company, the company’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the company’s backups, caches, and other systems. Other licenses you apply to content you submit, such as [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses, may continue after your content is removed. Those licenses may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content through the forum again.

Others who receive content you submit to the forum may violate the terms on which you license your content. You agree that the company will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.

## Your Responsibility

You agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the forum. Both you and the company agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as possible. If the company fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won’t have to indemnify the company for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice. You agree to allow the company to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts. The company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.

## Disclaimers

You accept all risks of using the forum and content on the forum. As far as the law allows, the company and its suppliers provide the forum as is, without any warranty whatsoever.

The forum may hyperlink to and integrate forums and services run by others. The company does not make any warranty about services run by others, or content they may provide. Use of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.

## Limits on Liability

Neither the company nor its suppliers will be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages their personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.

As far as the law allows, the total liability to you for claims of any kind that are related to the forum or content on the forum will be limited to $50.

## Feedback

The company welcomes your feedback and suggestions for the forum. See the [Contact](#contact) section below for ways to get in touch with us.

You agree that the company will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide, and that the company won’t have to notify you that your feedback was used, get your permission to use it, or pay you. You agree not to submit feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary, to you or others.

## Termination

Either you or the company may end the agreement written out in these terms at any time. When our agreement ends, your permission to use the forum also ends.

The following provisions survive the end of our agreement: [Your Content](#your-content), [Feedback](#feedback), [Your Responsibility](#your-responsibility), [Disclaimers](#disclaimers), [Limits on Liability](#limits-on-liability), and [General Terms](#general-terms).

## Disputes

The governing law will govern any dispute related to these terms or your use of the forum.

You and the company agree to seek injunctions related to these terms only in state or federal court in the city for disputes. Neither you nor the company will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts.

Other than to seek an injunction or for claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, you and the company will resolve any dispute by binding American Arbitration Association arbitration. Arbitration will follow the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. Arbitration will happen in the city for disputes. You will settle any dispute as an individual, and not as part of a class action or other representative proceeding, whether as the plaintiff or a class member. No arbitrator will consolidate any dispute with any other arbitration without the company’s permission.

Any arbitration award will include costs of the arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for witnesses. You and the company may enter arbitration awards in any court with jurisdiction.

## General Terms

If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. Otherwise, that provision should be removed.

You may not assign your agreement with the company. The company may assign your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company related to the forum. Any attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.

Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.

These terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and the company about use of the forum. These terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the forum, written or not.

## Contact

You may notify the company under these terms, and send questions to the company, at **info@threefold.io**.

The company may notify you under these terms using the e-mail address you provide for your account on the forum, or by posting a message to the homepage of the forum or your account page.

## Changes

The company last updated these terms on Aug, 2020, and may update these terms again. For updates that contain substantial changes, the company agrees to e-mail you, if you’ve created an account and provided a valid e-mail address. The company may also announce updates with special messages or alerts on the forum.

Once you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the forum.
