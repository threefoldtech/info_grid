## Use Terraform

Go in the directory of your terraform deployment and run the following command:

```
terraform destroy
```

## Easier Management of Resources

Use multiple accounts on TFChain and group your resources per account.

This gives you the following benefits:

- More control over TFT spending
- Easier to delete all your contracts
- Less chance to make mistakes
- Can use an account to share access with multiple people
