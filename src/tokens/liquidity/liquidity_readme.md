# Intro

A **liquidity provider** (LP) is an individual or entity that contributes liquidity to a decentralized exchange or automated market maker (AMM) platform. In the context of cryptocurrency, a liquidity provider typically deposits an equal value of two different tokens into a liquidity pool. By doing so, they enable traders to easily swap between these tokens at any time, ensuring there is sufficient liquidity in the market.
