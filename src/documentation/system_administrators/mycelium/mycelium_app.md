You can consult the [Mycelium hosted public nodes](./information.md#hosted-public-nodes) to find more peers.

For example, if you want to add the node with the IPv4 address `5.78.122.16` with the tcp port `9651`, simply add the following line then start or restart the app.

```
tcp://5.78.122.16:9651
```
