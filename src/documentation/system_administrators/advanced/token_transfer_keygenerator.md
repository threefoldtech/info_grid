## Introduction

Using this method, only transfer is possible between accounts that are generated in the same manner and that are yours. Please find the keygen tooling for it below.

## Prerequisites

### Keypair

- ed25519 keypair
- Go installed on your local computer

Create a keypair with the following tool: <https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain_tft/tree/main/tfchain_bridge/tools/keygen>

```sh
go build .
./keygen
```

### Stellar to TFChain

Create a Stellar wallet from the key that you generated.
Transfer the TFT from your wallet to the bridge address. A deposit fee of 1 TFT will be taken, so make sure you send a larger amount as 1 TFT.

Bridge addresses :

- On Mainnet: `GBNOTAYUMXVO5QDYWYO2SOCOYIJ3XFIP65GKOQN7H65ZZSO6BK4SLWSC` on [Stellar Mainnet](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public).
- On testnet: `GA2CWNBUHX7NZ3B5GR4I23FMU7VY5RPA77IUJTIXTTTGKYSKDSV6LUA4` on [Stellar MAINnet](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public)

The amount deposited on TF Chain minus 1 TFT will be transferred over the bridge to the TFChain account.

Effect will be the following :

- Transferred TFTs from Stellar will be sent to a Stellar vault account representing all tokens on TFChain
- TFTs will be minted on the TFChain for the transferred amount

### Alternative Transfer to TF Chain

We also enabled deposits to TF Grid objects. Following objects can be deposited to:

- Twin
- Farm
- Node
- Entity

To deposit to any of these objects, a memo text in format `object_objectID` must be passed on the deposit to the bridge wallet. Example: `twin_1`.

To deposit to a TF Grid object, this object **must** exists. If the object is not found on chain, a refund is issued.

## TFChain to Stellar

Create a TFChain account from the key that you generated. (TF Chain raw seed).
Browse to :

- For mainnet: <https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.grid.tf#/accounts>
- For testnet: <https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.test.grid.tf#/accounts>
- For Devnet: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.dev.grid.tf#/accounts

-> Add Account -> Click on mnemonic and select `Raw Seed` -> Paste raw TF Chain seed.

Select `Advanced creation options` -> Change `keypair crypto type` to `Edwards (ed25519)`. Click `I have saved my mnemonic seed safely` and proceed.

Choose a name and password and proceed.

Browse to the [extrinsics](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.test.grid.tf#/extrinsics) <!--- or [Devnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.dev.grid.tf#/extrinsics) -->, select tftBridgeModule and extrinsic: `swap_to_stellar`. Provide your Bridge substrate address and the amount to transfer. Sign using your password.
Again, a withdrawfee of 1 TFT will be taken, so make sure you send an amount larger than 1 TFT.

The amount withdrawn from TFChain will be sent to your Stellar wallet.

Behind the scenes, following will happen:

- Transferred TFTs from Stellar will be sent from the Stellar vault account to the user's Stellar account
- TFTs will be burned on the TFChain for the transferred amount

Example: ![swap_to_stellar](img/swap_to_stellar.png ':size=400')
