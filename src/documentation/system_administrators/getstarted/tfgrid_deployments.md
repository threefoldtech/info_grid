## Introduction

There are many ways to interact with the ThreeFold Grid to deploy workloads. We present the main ones.

## Dashboard UI

We provide an easy-to-use user interface via the ThreeFold Dashboard and its many apps.

## Infrastrure-As-Code

You can deploy infrastructure-as-code with Pulumi and Terraform/OpenTofu.
