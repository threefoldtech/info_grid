<h1>Twin Management</h1>

The TF Twin management feature of the ThreeFold Dashboard enables users to create, manage, and monitor their individual digital entities known as **Twins**. A Twin can represent a virtual machine (VM) or a container running on the ThreeFold Grid. With the Twin management, users can easily deploy and scale their workloads, allocate resources, and configure networking and storage settings for their Twins.
