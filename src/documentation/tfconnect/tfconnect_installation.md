## Create Account

Once you've accepted the Terms and Conditions, you can either *Create Account* or *Log In*. For now, we will show how to creae a new account. Later in the guide, we will show you how to log in, which can be used to recover your account.

To create a new account, you will be asked to choose a `Threefold Connect Id`. This ID will be used, as well as the seed phrase, when you want to log in after having logged out of your account.

You will also need to add a valid email address. You will need to access your email and confirm the validation email from ThreeFold to use properly the TF Connect app wallet.

You will be shown your seed phrase. Keep this in a secure and offline place. You will need the 3bot ID and the seed phrase to recover your account. This seed phrase is of utmost importance. Do not lose it nor give it to anyone.

Once you've hit Next, you will be asked to write down 3 random words of your seed phrase. This is a necessary step to ensure you have taken the time to write down your seed phrase.

Then, you'll be asked to confirm your TF 3bot name and the associated email.

Finally, you will be asked to choose a 4-digit PIN. This will be needed to use the ThreeFold Connect app. If you ever forget this 4-digit PIN, you will need to recover your account from your 3bot name and your seed phrase. You will need to confirm the new pin in the next step.

That's it! You've created your ThreeFold Connect account.

## Email Verification

Once you've created your account, an email will be sent to the email address you've chosen in the account creation process. 

To verify your email, go to your email account and open the email sent by *tfconnect@threefold.io* with the subject *Verify your email address*. 

In this email, click on the link *Verify my email address*. This will lead you to a *login.threefold.me* link. The process should be automatic. Once this is done, you will receive a confirmation on screen, as well as on your phone.

If for some reason, you did not receive the verification email, go to the home menu and click on `Identify`. Then click on `Verify`. Another verification email will be sent.
