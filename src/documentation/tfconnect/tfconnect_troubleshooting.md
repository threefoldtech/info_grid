<h1> ThreeFold Connect Troubleshooting </h1>



## Introduction

We provide solutions to different issues users can encounter while using the ThreeFold Connect app.

## Basic Troubleshooting

### I am trying to access my wallet in the ThreeFold Connect App. It worked fine before, but now I just get a white screen. What does it mean and what can I do?

On the TF Connect App, when you get a white screen, it means that there is a connection issue. It can help to try other networks; maybe try switching between ethernet cable or wifi. Or you can also try it later when the connection might be more stable.



### When I open the ThreeFold Connect App, I get the error: Error in initialization in Flagsmith. How can I fix this issue?

To fix this Flagsmith error message on the ThreeFold Connect app, you can try the following methods:

* Check your internet connection
* Update your phone current operating system (OS) version
* Update the date and time on your phone


### I do not remember the name (ThreeFold 3bot ID) associated with my seed phrase on the ThreeFold Connect app. Can I recover my TF Connect app account with only the seed phrase and not the name (3bot ID) associated with it?

If you forgot the name associated with your seed phrase on the TF Connect app, you can always create a new identity (ThreeFold 3bot ID) and import your wallet using the old seed phrase. 

Since the Connect App is also used for identity and authentication, you need both the name (3bot ID) and seed phrase to fully recover your account. The wallet is only linked to the seed phrase and not the name (3bot ID).

### TF Connect App is now asking for a 4-digit password (PIN). I don't remember it as I usually use touch or face ID to unlock the app. What can I do?

When you set up your the app, you are asked a 4-digit password (PIN). After some time, the app will be asking for this PIN when users may have been exclusively using touch/face ID. You can reset it by recovering the account with your seedphrase.


### Is there a way to have more than one wallet in TF Connect App?

Yes, this is perfectly possible. You can have multiple wallets in the TF Connect app. You can have multiple wallets for the Stellar network and multiple wallets for Polkadot Substrate.

For example, you can create a wallet on the Stellar Blockchain and import it on TF Connect App with the function *Import Wallet*. Just copy the seedphrase and it will be imported in TF Connect App. 

Note: There will not be an automatic function in the app to create a new wallet. You must do it manually.


### On the ThreeFold Connect App, it says I need to migrate my Titan farm from V2 to V3. What do I have to do? How long does this take?

To migrate, read [this documentation](https://forum.threefold.io/t/what-to-do-if-your-farm-is-still-on-grid-v2-closed/3761).
