# Utilization Rewards

## Introduction

50% of proof-of-utilization rewards goes to the farmer running the 3Node. This means that farmers get paid in TFT 50% of what is spent to utilize their nodes. 

## Process

- Payments go to the TFChain wallet associated with the farm's twin.
- Billing usually happens every hour, but funds are deposited into the farmer's wallet less frequently. The frequency is between 5 to 16 hours.

## Payment Information

- Currently, there is no way to gather information on these payments. 
  - If the farmer isn't using the wallet for anything else than farming, i.e. the wallet is not used to deploy workloads, the farmer will be able to see the TFT amount on their wallet accumulate.
