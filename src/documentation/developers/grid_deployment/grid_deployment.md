# Grid Deployment

The TFGrid whole source code is open-source and instances of the grid can be deployed by anyone thanks to the distribution of daily grid snapshots of the complete ThreeFold Grid stacks.

This section also covers the steps to deploy the Dashboard locally. This can be useful when testing the grid or contributing to the open-source project.
