## Introduction

We present here the main steps to use the BSC-Stellar Bridge. 



## How to Use the BSC-Stellar Bridge

To use the BSC-Stellar Bridge, follow the following steps. If this is your first time with MetaMask and BSC, read the section [Setting up TFT on Metamask](#setting-up-tft-on-metamask).

It will cost 100 TFT* to bridge from Stellar to BSC, and 1 TFT to bridge from BSC to Stellar. There is also a fixed fee of 0.01 TFT when using the Stellar blockchain. Those fees are taken from the total of what you are bridging. 

*For example, if you Bridge 200 TFT, from Stellar to BSC, you will receive 100 TFT.

> Note: The bridge will process deposits/withdrawals within 48 hours.


### Bridge from Stellar to BSC

**Pre-requisites:**

* Metamask account
* TF Connect App+Wallet
* TFT on Stellar Blockchain

**Steps**

1. Go to the BSC-Stellar [Bridge website](https://bridge.bsc.threefold.io/).
2. Connect your MetaMask Wallet.
3. Sign in with MetaMask.
4. Choose the option  *Deposit from Stellar*.
5. Agree to the  *ThreeFold Terms*.
6. Read and tick the box of the  *Warning Message*.
7. On your phone, open up your ThreeFold Connect App and go to the wallet section.
8. Select the option  *Send*.
9. Select the  *Stellar*  chain.
10. Click on the button  *Scan QR Code* . The QR Code option automatically fill up your  *MESSAGE*.
11. Scan the QR code that appears on the Bridge window (or write the information manually).
12. Make sure the  *MESSAGE*  is correctly entered.
13. Press  *Send Tokens*.
14. Press  *Confirm*.

In this method, you use the Bridge directly. Thus, it is normal if you do not see your standard MetaMask address. MetaMask is on ERC20 and TFT is on Stellar. You are sending TFT to the Bridge's address, and the Bridge sends money to your wallet afterward.
