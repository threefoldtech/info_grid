## Notes

Here are some notes to take into account when doing TFT transfers:

* The fees paid directly by the users will be shown in the user's wallet at transaction time, not on the bridge page.
* The bridge fees can vary based on current on-chain gas prices. The current fee will always be shown on the bridge page before a transaction is initiated.
