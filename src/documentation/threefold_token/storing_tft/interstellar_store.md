> If you are looking for ways to get / purchase TFT (Stellar) on Interstellar by trading, you will find the according information [here](../buy_sell_tft/interstellar.md).

## Prerequisites

- **XLM**: To get TFT tokens using Interstellar, a certain amount of XLM funding is required to facilitate the sending and receiving of assets on the Stellar network. 

If you already have some XLMs stored in another Stellar wallet or exchange, you could simply withdraw them to your new Interstellar account after you complete the signup process (we will explain how to do it later on). If not, there are multiple ways to acquire XLM and send it to your wallet. One option is to utilize XLM-supported exchanges, which provide a convenient platform for purchasing XLM. Click [**here**](https://www.coinlore.com/coin/stellar/exchanges) to access a comprehensive list of exchanges that support XLM.

As an example, we have created a tutorial specifically focusing on how to buy XLM on Coinbase, one of the popular cryptocurrency exchanges. This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on the process of purchasing XLM on **Coinbase Exchange**. You can find the tutorial [**here**](../buy_sell_tft/coinbase_xlm.md).

Write down your Secret Key, which is needed to recover access to your account in case of a password loss or if your phone is lost or stolen. The word order is very important.  

Note: It is essential to save your secret key securely during the process of creating a new account or importing an existing one. The secret key is a critical component that grants access to your wallet and funds. Make sure to store it in a safe and offline location, such as a password manager or a physical backup, to prevent unauthorized access. Do not share your secret key with anyone and exercise caution to protect your assets.

Tick all the boxes and click '**Go to Account**' to proceed.

We have funded our wallet with $408 or 10.000 XLMs for this manual as you can see these are now shown in the account overview.

This step is obligatory because you will need to pay some XLM in order to start adding TFT asset to your wallet in the following tutorial below.

### Adding TFT as an Asset

To store and trade TFT in your Interstellar wallet, we will need to have a TFT wallet added into our account. This is done by  adding TFT Asset. This will allow you to view your TFT balance, send and receive TFT tokens, and engage in trading activities involving TFT within the Solar wallet.

To add the TFT (ThreeFold Token) asset to your Solar Wallet account, follow these steps:

Click on '**Add Token**' button on your wallet homepage.

At the pop-up 'Select Asset; window,  and click on All (unverified) option. From there you can search for **TFT** and it will show TFT and Click on the TFT icon. 

**IMPORTANT**: It is important to ensure that you also see the name "**threefold.io**" next to the logo , as this verifies that you are selecting the genuine TFT asset associated with ThreeFold. **Beware of imposters or fraudulent assets that may attempt to mimic TFT.** ThreeFold cannot assume responsibility for any errors or mistakes made during the trustline creation process done by users. If you have any uncertainties or doubts, it is always recommended to seek assistance from official support channels or trusted sources to ensure the accuracy of the trustline configuration.
