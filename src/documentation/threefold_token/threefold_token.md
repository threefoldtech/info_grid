## Introduction to TFT

The ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, and application) on the ThreeFold Grid. 

ThreeFold Tokens are generated through a process called “Farming”. Farming happens when active internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. Independent farmers earn ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) by providing neutral and decentralized internet capacity, thus expending the usable TF Grid. Therefore no central entity controls the internet.

## Chains with TFT

TFT lives on 4 different chains: TFChain, Stellar chain, Ethereum chain and Binance Smart Chain. 

- TFT are minted on the Stellar chain.
- TFT are used to deploy workloads on TFChain. 
- TFT can be transacted on Ethereum chain, Binance Smart Chain and Stellar chain.
