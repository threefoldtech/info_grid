## Introduction

In this guide, we present how to buy and sell ThreeFold Tokens on BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum using [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).

**BNB Smart Chain** and **Ethereum** chain are blockchain networks that enable the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications, while **MetaMask** is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain.

## TFT Addresses

With MetaMask, you can buy and sell TFT on both BNB Smart Chain and the Ethereum chain. Make sure to use the correct TFT address when doing transactions.

### Ethereum Chain Address

The ThreeFold Token (TFT) is available on Ethereum.
It is implemented as a wrapped asset with the following token address:

```
0x395E925834996e558bdeC77CD648435d620AfB5b
```

### BSC Address

The ThreeFold Token (TFT) is available on BSC.
It is implemented as a wrapped asset with the following token address:

```
0x8f0FB159380176D324542b3a7933F0C2Fd0c2bbf
```

## Add TFT to Metamask

We present the steps on Ethereum chain. Make sure to switch to BSC and to use the TFT BSC address if you want to proceed on BSC.

Open Metamask and import the ThreeFold Token. First click on `import tokens`:

To add the ThreeFold Token, paste its Ethereum address in the field `Token contract address field`. The address is the following:

```
0x395E925834996e558bdeC77CD648435d620AfB5b
```

Once you paste the TFT contract address, the parameter `Token symbol` should automatically be filled with `TFT`. 

Click on the button `Add Custom Token`.
