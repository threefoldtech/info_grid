## More on TFT

The [Threefold token (TFT)](../threefold_token.md) is the token of the Threefold Grid, a decentralized and open-source project offering network, compute and storage capacity. TFTs are created by TFChain, the ThreeFold blockchain, only when new Internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid by cloud service providers (farmers) deploying 3Nodes, a process we call [farming](../../farmers/farmers.md).
