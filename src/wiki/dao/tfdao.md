# ThreeFold DAO

![](img/dao_whatis_.jpg)

The ThreeFold DAO allows autonomous operation of the TFChain and TFGrid.

Amongst others the DAO needs to arrange

| Utility Token model                          |                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| [Proof Of Capacity](../tfgrid/farming/proof_of_capacity.md)       | Farming (creation) of TFT                  |
| [Proof Of Utilization](../tfgrid/farming/proof_of_utilization.md) | Utilization (burning, distribution) of TFT |

As well as

- distribution of TFT grants
- manage code upgrade of TFChain and ZOS
- approval for changes to anything in our ecosystem, by means of GEP e.g.
  - changes to tokenomics e.g. changes related to
    - farming rewards
    - cultivation flows
  - pricing of grid capacity
  - new features in TFChain
  - rewards for sales channels, solution providers (v3.2+)
