## Introduction

In this Threefold Guide, we show how easy it is to deploy a full virtual machine (VM) and SSH into a 3node on Windows with [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/).

To deploy different workloads, the SSH connection process should be very similar.

If you have any questions, feel free to write a post on the [Threefold Forum](http://forum.threefold.io/).

## Main Steps and Prerequisites

The prerequisites are:

* [Create a Threefold Connect Wallet](../../threefold_token/storing_tft/tf_connect_app.md#create-a-wallet)
* [Buy TFT](../../threefold_token/buy_sell_tft/buy_sell_tft.md)
* [Create a Threefold Dashboard Account and Transfer TFT](../TF_Dashboard/TF_Dashboard.md#create-polkadot-extension-account)

The main steps for the whole process are the following:

* Create an SSH Key pair
* Deploy a 3node
  * Choose IPv4 or the Planetary Network
* SSH into the 3node
  * For the Planetary Network, download the Planetary Network Connector

## SSH with PuTTY on Windows

Here are the main steps to SSH into a full VM using PuTTY on a Windows machine.

* Download [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)
  * You can download the Windows Installer in .msi format [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
  * This will add both PuTTY and PuTTYgen to your computer
  * Make sure that you have the latest version of PuTTY to avoid potential issues
* Generate an SSH key pair
  * Open PuTTYgen
  * In `Parameters`, you can set the type of key to `RSA` or to `EdDSA`
  * Click on `Generate`
  * Add a passphrase for your private key (optional)
  * Take note of the generated SSH public key
    * You will need to paste it to the Playground later
  * Click `Save private key`
* Deploy a full VM on the [Threefold Playground](https://play.grid.tf/)
  * In the profile manager settings
    * Paste your seed phrase
    * Paste the SSH public key generated by PuTTYgen
      * To make sure that you copy the public key in the proper format, after generating the key pair in PuTTYgen
        * Right-click on the window where the public key is presented, select `Select All`, then right-click again and select `copy`
  * Deploy a full virtual machine
    * Choose the parameters you want
      * Minimum CPU: 1 vCore
      * Minimum Memory: 512 Mb
      * Minimum Disk Size: 15 Gb
    * Select IPv4 in `Network`
    * In `Node Selection`
      * Select `Capacity Filter`
      * Select `Apply Filters and Suggest Nodes`
    * Click `Deploy`
    * Once the 3Node is deployed
      * Take note of the IPv4 address of the full VM
* Connect to the full VM with PuTTY
  * Open PuTTY
  * Go to the section `Session`
    * Add the VM IPv4 address under `Host Name (or IP address)`
    * Make sure `Connection type` is set to `SSH`
  * Go to the section `Connection` -> `SSH` -> `Auth` -> `Credentials`
    * Under `Private key file for authentication`, click on `Browse...`
      * Look for the generated SSH private key in .ppk format and click `Open`
  * In the main `PuTTY` window, click `Open`
  * In the PuTTY terminal window, enter `root` as the login parameter
  * Enter the passphrase for the private key if you set one

You now have an SSH connection on Windows with IPv4.
