## Introduction

For this section, we will create an account on the TFChain and transfer TFT from Stellar chain to TFChain. We will then be able to use the TFT and deploy workloads on the Threefold Playground.

## Create Polkadot Extension Account

Go to the Threefold Dashboard: [dashboard.grid.tf](https://dashboard.grid.tf/)

If you don't have the Polkadot extension installed on your browser, you will be able to click on the download link directly on the Threefold Dashboard page:

For this next step, you should be very careful. Your seed phrase is your only access to your account. Make sure to keep a copy somewhere safe and offline.

That's it! You've successfully created an account on the TFChain thanks to the Polkadot extension. You can now access the Threefold Dashboard.

On to the next section! Where we will transfer (or swap) TFT from the Stellar Chain on your Threefold Connect app wallet to the TFChain on the Threefold Dashboard.

You'll see, this is so easy thanks to the Threefold Dashboard configuration.

## Transfer TFT from Stellar Chain to TFChain

On the [Threefold Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/), click on the **Portal**, then click on **Swap**.

Make sure the chain **stellar** is selected. Then click **Deposit**, as we want to deposit TFT from the Stellar Chain to the TFChain.

This will automatically write the correct address and twin ID.

You can now write the amount of TFT you wish to send, and then click **SEND**

> We recommend to try with a small amount of TFT first to make sure everything is OK.
>
> The transfer fees are of 1 TFT per transfer.
