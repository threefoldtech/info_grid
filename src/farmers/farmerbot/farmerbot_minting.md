## Introduction

We cover essential features of ThreeFold minting in relation with the Farmerbot. 

## Minting Rules

There are certain minting rules that are very important when it comes to farming on the ThreeFold Grid while using the Farmerbot.

- The 3Node should wake up within 30 minutes of setting the power target to **Up**.
  - If the 3Node does not respect this rule, the 3Node won't mint for the whole minting period.
- The 3Node must wake up at least once every 24 hours.
  - If the 3Node does not respect this rule, the 3Node won't mint for a 24-hour period.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the Farmerbot is an optional feature developed by ThreeFold. Please use at your own risk. While ThreeFold will do its best to fix any issues with the Farmerbot and minting, if minting is affected by the use of the Farmerbot, ThreeFold cannot be held responsible.
