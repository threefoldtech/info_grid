<h1> Farmerbot </h2>

The Farmerbot is a service that farmers can run in order to automatically manage the nodes in their farms. The behavior of the farmerbot is customizable through markup definition files.

We present here two guides to accompany farmers in setting up the Farmerbot. The quick guide contains the essential information to deploy the Farmerbot on the TFGrid. It also shows how to quickly create the configuration files by using the Farmerbot file creator. The extensive guide contains additional information and details on the working of the Farmerbot.

For more information on the Farmerbot, you can visit the [Farmerbot repository](https://github.com/threefoldtech/farmerbot) on Github. You can also consult the Farmerbot FAQ if needed.
