## Introduction

Farmers can set additional fees for their 3Nodes on the [TF Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/). By doing so, users will then be able to [reserve the 3Node and use it as a dedicated node](../../dashboard/deploy/dedicated_machines.md).
This can be useful for farmers who provide additional values to their 3Nodes, e.g. a GPU card and/or high-quality hardware.

## Steps

Here are the steps to [set additional fees](../../dashboard/farms/your_farms.md#extra-fees) to a 3Node. 

* On the Dashboard, go to **Farms** -> **Your Farms**
* Under the section **Your Nodes**, locate the 3Node and click **Set Additional Fees** under **Actions**
* Set a monthly fee (in USD) and click **Set**

## TFT Payments

When a user reserves your 3Node, you will receive TFT payments once every 24 hours. These TFT payments will be sent to the TFChain account of your farm's twin.

## Dedicated Nodes Notice

Note that while any 3Node that has no workload can be reserved by a TF user as a dedicated node, when a farmer sets additional fees to a 3Node, this 3Node automatically becomes a dedicated node. For a user to run workloads on this 3Node, the 3Node must then be reserved, i.e rented as a dedicated node.
