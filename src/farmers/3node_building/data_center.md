## Set Up a Threefold Farm in a Data Center

Setting up a Threefold farm in a data center has a lot in common with setting up a farm at home. But some details should be taken into account.

For farmers who want to set up a Threefold farm in a data center, the Gold Farming Certification can be very interesting. Indeed, Gold Farming Certification comes with 50% more farming reward and a better storage unit calculation price.

Following the requirements for Gold Farming Certification will ensure an efficient Threefold farm in a data center environment.

## Data Center Cable Management

It's important to have a good cable management, specially if you are in a data center. Proper cable management will improve the cooling streams of your farm. There shouldn't be any cable in front of the fans. This way, your servers will last longer. If you want to patch a rack, you have to have all lenght of patch cables from 30cm to 3m. Also, try to keep the cables as short as possible. Arrange the cables in bundles of eight and lead them to the sides of the rack as much as possible for optimal airflow.
