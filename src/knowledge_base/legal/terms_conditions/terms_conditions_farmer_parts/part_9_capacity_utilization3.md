### 9. CAPACITY UTILIZATION (‘UTILIZATION’) FOR TFGRID 3.X

#### 9.1 General Principles

Users (such as developers or other persons requiring IT Capacity) can use IT Capacity from the ThreeFold_Grid in exchange for ThreeFold_Tokens (TFTs), which creates a natural economic demand. We call this process of using IT Capacity on the ThreeFold_Grid "**Utilization**".

ThreeFold_Tokens (TFTs) are used to buy IT Capacity as delivered by the 3Nodes (by a process called Farming) on the ThreeFold_Grid. The capacity can be consulted by means of a tool called TF Explorer see http://explorer.grid.tf.

#### 9.2 Utilization Mechanism

IT capacity is expressed in [network, compute & storage units](../../cloud/cloudunits.md).

- CU = Compute Units
- SU = Storage Units
- NU = Network Units

TF Explorer is the inventory of all IT capacity available for consumption on the ThreeFold_Grid. See http://explorer.grid.tf/

TFT received for people using capacity is disributed as follows:

| Percentage | Description                            | Remark                                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 35%        | needs to be burned                     | results in more TFT burned compared to generated once grid more mature.  |
| 10%        | to TF Foundation                       | used to promote the manage the project.                                  |
| 5%         | to Staking Pool for TF Validators | used to reward the people who run the TFChain 3.0 blockchain validators. |
| 50%        | for solution providers & sales channel | managed by [ThreeFold DAO](../../about/dao/dao.md).                                       |

#### 9.4 Taxes

You (The Farmer) will be responsible for payment of all applicable taxes (if any) associated with your Utilization of ThreeFold_Tokens (i.e. sale of IT Capacity), including but not limited to value added taxes, sales taxes, custom taxes, and taxes on gross receipts and income.

The Farmer shall seek all necessary tax advice in order to comply with any applicable tax regulations when providing IT Capacity to Users on the ThreeFold_Grid. By way of example, the Farmer acknowledges that within the European Union, as from 1 January 2015, telecommunications, broadcasting and electronically supplied services are always taxed in the country of the customer (i.e. the tax residence of the User) – regardless of whether the User is a business or a consumer.

In view thereof, the Farmer will determine the applicable Farmer’s Compute Unit Price and Storage unit Price (as referred to in section 9.2 above) taking into account any aforementioned taxes that may apply. ThreeFold will not be held liable for the Farmer’s failure to comply with its legal obligations, including but not limited to its obligation to pay any applicable taxes, and the Farmer will indemnify and hold harmless the Company for claims against the Company from any tax authorities in respect of such non-compliance by the Farmer.

#### 9.5 Modification

The Company reserves the right to modify the terms of this section 9 (‘_CAPACITY UTILIZATION (‘UTILIZATION’)_) at any time. Such amendments will be subject to the approval of the TFChain Validators who protect the TFChain (Substrate based chain on Level 1) through our DAO.

In case of modification to these terms, the Company or DAO shall inform the Farmers and Community at least one month in advance by means of forum or chat or other mechanism. In case the Farmer would not agree to such modifications, the Farmer shall have the right to immediately and unilaterally terminate this Agreement by disconnecting the Farming Pool from the ThreeFold_Grid.

The TFChain and TFGrid capabilities & specifications can change over time after getting consensus from the DAO .
The specific requirements and workings of the DAO are or will be publised on our wikisystem: https://library.threefold.me

If the DAO (by means of X nr of members of the Community or Validators) agree on a change of the protocol used or specifications for the Software or TFGrid then the Validators can allow and execute an upgrade of the system (TFChain as well as ZERO-OS software). Farmers and Users accept changes introduced this way, they accept that any of above mentioned variables can be changed that way.


#### 9.6 Breach

In addition to its other rights and remedies under this Agreement, the Farmer forfeit any right to compensation under this Agreement if Farmer breaches any terms thereof.
