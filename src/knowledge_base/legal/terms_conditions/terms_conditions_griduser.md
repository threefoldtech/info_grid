- to store data and materials by Users on your 3Node(s) (the "**Content**") and to access such Content from your 3Node(s) at any time

in accordance with the capabilities of the software installed on the 3Nodes;

### 4. REGISTRATION TO THE THREEFOLD CONNECT (FORMERLY 3BOT CONNECT) APPLICATION

In order to access certain TF Products you will be required to install the ThreeFold Connect application on your device and register your account in this ThreeFold Connect application by creating a username and password. You agree to provide us with accurate, complete, and current registration information about yourself. It is your responsibility to ensure that your password remains confidential and secure. By registering, you agree that you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your user name and password. We may assume that any communications we receive under your account have been made by you. If you are a billing owner, an administrator, or if you have confirmed in writing that you have the authority to make decisions on behalf of a User ("**3Bot Administrator**"), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to make decisions on behalf of the User and agree that ThreeFold is entitled to rely on your instructions.

You are responsible for notifying us at legal@threefold.io if you become aware of any unauthorized use of or access to your 3Bot account. You understand and agree that we may require you to provide information that may be used to confirm your identity and help ensure the security of your account. ThreeFold will not be liable for any loss, damages, liability, expenses or attorneys’ fees that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge and/or authorization, and regardless of whether you have or have not advised us of such unauthorized use. You will be liable for losses, damages, liability, expenses and attorneys’ fees incurred by ThreeFold or a third party due to someone else using your account. In the event that the 3Bot Administrator or User loses access to an account or otherwise requests information about an account, ThreeFold reserves the right to request from the 3Bot Administrator or User any verification it deems necessary before restoring access to or providing information about such account in its sole discretion.

### 5. USE OF THREEFOLD TOKENS

ThreeFold_Tokens (TFTs) are a digital token used to buy autonomous and decentralized IT Capacity (compute, storage, network, IT services, applications) on the ThreeFold_Grid. TFTs have a specific commercial utility, since ThreeFold_Tokens were conceived as the designated currency for buying and selling IT Capacity on the ThreeFold_Grid.

TFTs are exclusively generated through a process called Farming, which means that TFTs are created only when new IT Capacity is added to the ThreeFold_Grid. TFTs are registered on a blockchain which is part of the Stellar Network ([https://stellar.org](https://stellar.org/)), Binance Smart Chain, a Cosmos Chain or our own TFChain.

The first batch of TFTs that got registered in the blockchain consists of the ‘Genesis Block’ of 685 million TFTs that were Farmed by or on behalf of the Company using an initial Farming Pool, also known as the Genesis Pool.

Two versions of ThreeFold_Tokens have been issued:

- A first version of the ThreeFold_Token was issued as from March 2018 on ThreeFolds initial blockchain called Rivine. These TFTs are also referred to as "TFTv1" or “TFTA”. These tokens have now been migrated to the Stellar blockchain.
- A second version of the ThreeFold_Token was issued as from May 2020 on the Stellar blockchain. These TFTs are also referred to as "TFTv2". This token is available on multiple blockchains, the total amount of tokens farmed is the same independent of blockchain used, TFBridges are used to migrate TFTs between blockchain technology.

While the original TFTv1 kept all same properties and benefits, they are now called TFTA on the Stellar blockchain. Since the creation of the TFTv2, TFTA’s have become ThreeFolds voluntary staking pool of Tokens, which means these TFTs can only be used to buy IT Capacity and cannot be traded otherwise. However any User can convert TFTA’s into TFTs (i.e. TFTv2) by implementing a few simple migration steps which can be found [here](./tfta_to_tft.md). Once converted, any TFT’s can be traded or transferred by various means as the User deems fit, as further explain [here](../../../documentation/threefold_token/buy_sell_tft/buy_sell_tft.md).

The TF Foundation has chosen to use multiple blockchain technology for storing and managing the TFT. You can use any wallet that supports the chosen blockchain, including but not limited to the wallet included in the ThreeFold Connect app.

Your use of the TF Products and/or TFTs constitutes your acknowledgement of the aforementioned general principles relating to the ThreeFold_Tokens. As a User you furthermore acknowledge that:

- each TFT constitutes a value of exchange on the ThreeFold_Grid;
- you have been advised that the ThreeFold_Tokens are the result of farming which means a Farmer connects IT Capacity to the ThreeFold_Grid;
- as such the TFTs have not been registered under any country’s securities laws;
- TFTs are neither securities nor an investment instrument; and
- the purchase, creation or use of TFTs involve risks, all of which the User fully and completely assumes by entering into this Agreement.

### 6. MODIFICATIONS TO THE TF PRODUCTS

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any TF Products (or any features or functionality thereof) at any time without notice and without obligation or liability to you. You agree that ThreeFold shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the TF Products or related services.
