## Introduction

Z-OS (Zero Operating System) is a lightweight and secure operating system designed specifically for running workloads on the ThreeFold Grid. Z-OS provides a minimalistic and containerized environment for applications, enabling efficient resource allocation and management. With Z-OS, developers can deploy their applications easily and take advantage of the scalability and resilience offered by the ThreeFold Grid.

## Overview of Zero-OS

ThreeFold built this decentralized autonomous operating system (OS) from scratch, starting with just a Linux kernel, for the purpose of dedicating hardware capacity to users of the TF Grid. 

Based on ThreeFoldâ€™s open-source technology, Zero-OS is a stateless and lightweight operating system that allows for an improved efficiency of up to 10x for certain workloads. Our OS achieves unparalleled levels of efficiency and security. With no remote shell or login and extremely small footprint, Zero-OS ensures that hosted workloads are protected from administrative exploits and human intervention.

All 3Nodes are booted with Zero-OS to provide the storage, compute and network primitives for our open-source peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure. Due to the unique design of Zero-OS, any server-like hardware with an AMD or Intel processor can be booted and dedicated to the network. 

Zero-OS runs autonomously on 3Nodes once booted, requiring no maintenance or administration. The process is actually quite simple, also enabling people without technical skills to join the TFGrid by connecting a node in their home or office with full data sovereignty and security. 

## Zero-OS Advantages 

Zero-OS provides many advantages: deterministic deployment, zero hacking surface, unbreakable storage and more.
