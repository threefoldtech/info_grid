## Introduction

Within the ThreeFold Grid, we offer a range of __low-level constructs known as Primitives__. These powerful functionalities enable you to create diverse and customized solutions atop the grid, opening up a world of possibilities. It's important to note that any application compatible with Linux can seamlessly run on the ThreeFold Grid, ensuring maximum flexibility.

## Compute

Harness the power of computation with our compute primitives, measured in [compute units](../../cloud/cloudunits.md) (CU).

- [ZKube](../../technology/primitives/compute/zkube.md): Deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters effortlessly.
- [ZMachine](../../technology/primitives/compute/zmachine.md): Run your applications within containers or virtual machines powered by the Zero-OS operating system.
- [CoreX](../../technology/primitives/compute/corex.md) (optional): Gain remote access to your ZMachine by utilizing the CoreX process manager.

## Storage

Leverage our robust storage Primitives, measured in [storage units](../../cloud/cloudunits.md) (SU), to meet your data storage requirements efficiently.

- [ZOS Filesystem](../../technology/primitives/storage/zos_fs.md): Enjoy a deduplicated and immutable filesystem for secure and reliable data storage.
- [ZOS Mount](../../technology/primitives/storage/zmount.md): Utilize a portion of a high-speed SSD (Solid State Drive) as a mounted disk directly accessible within your ZMachine.
- [Quantum Safe Filesystem](../../technology/primitives/storage/qsfs.md): Secure your data with an unbreakable storage system, ideal for secondary storage needs.
- [Zero-DB](../../technology/primitives/storage/zdb.md): Experience a powerful key-value storage mechanism that serves as the foundation for other storage mechanisms.
- [Zero-Disk](../../technology/primitives/storage/zdisk.md) (OEM only): Employ a virtual disk format designed exclusively for original equipment manufacturers.

## Network

Harness our network Primitives, measured in [network units](../../cloud/cloudunits.md) (CU), to enable seamless communication and connectivity.

- [ZNET](../../technology/primitives/network/znet.md): Establish private networks between ZMachines, ensuring secure and efficient communication.
- [ZNIC](../../technology/primitives/network/znic.md): Access and manage network interfaces within the Planetary Network, enabling efficient data transfer and communication.
- [WebGateway](../../technology/primitives/network/webgw3.md): Connect your ZNET to the internet with ease, facilitating seamless integration with the wider network.

## Zero-OS Advantages

Enjoy the [numerous advantages](../../technology/zos/benefits/zos_advantages.md) that Zero-OS brings to the table.

- [Zero Install](../../technology/zos/benefits/zos_advantages.md#zero-os-installation): Experience hassle-free deployment without the need for complex installations.
- [Unbreakable Storage](../../technology/zos/benefits/zos_advantages.md#unbreakable-storage): Ensure the integrity and security of your data with our robust storage mechanisms.
- [Zero Hacking Surface](../../technology/zos/benefits/zos_advantages.md#zero-hacking-surface): Benefit from a minimized attack surface, bolstering the security of your infrastructure.
- [Zero Boot](../../technology/zos/benefits/zos_advantages.md#zero-boot): Enjoy lightning-fast boot times, allowing for swift and efficient system initialization.
- [Deterministic Deployment](../../technology/zos/benefits/zos_advantages.md#deterministic-deployment): Achieve consistent and predictable deployments, streamlining your development process.
- [ZOS Protect](../../technology/zos/benefits/zos_advantages.md#zero-os-protect): Experience enhanced protection and security measures to safeguard your infrastructure.

## Conclusion

With these powerful Primitives and Zero-OS advantages, the ThreeFold Grid empowers you to build, scale, and secure your solutions with ease. Unleash your creativity and unlock limitless possibilities within the ThreeFold ecosystem.
