## Quantum Safe Storage use cases

### Backup

A perfect use case for the QSS is backup.  Specific capbabilities needed for backup are a core part of a proper backup policy.  Characteristics of QSS that makle backups secure, scalable, efficient and sustainable are:
- physical storage devices are always append. The lowest level of the storage devices, ZDB's, are storage engines that work by design as an always append storage device.
- easy provision of these ZDB's makes them almost like old fashioned tape devices that you have on a rotary schedule.  Having this capability make is very visible and possible to use, store and phase out stored data in a way that is auditable and can be made very transparant
