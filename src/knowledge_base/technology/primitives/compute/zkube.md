<h1> ZKube </h1>



## Introduction

TFGrid is compatible with Kubernetes Technology.

Each eVDC as shown above is a full blown Kubernetes deployment.

## Unique for our Kubernetes implementation

- The Kubernetes networks are on top of our [ZNet](../network/znet.md) technology which means all traffic between containers and kubernetes hosts is end2end encrypted independent of where your Kubernetes nodes are deployed.
- You can mount a QSFS underneath a Kubernetes Node (VM), which means that you can deploy containers on top of QSFS to host unlimited amounts of storage in a super safe way.
- You Kubernetes environment is for sure 100% decentralized, you define where you want to deploy your Kubernetes nodes and only you have access to the deployed workloads on the TFGrid.

## Features

*   integration with znet (efficient, secure encrypted network between the zmachines)
*   can be easily deployed at the edge
*   single-tenant!

## ZMachine Benefits

*   [ZOS Protect](../../zos/benefits/zos_advantages.md#zero-os-protect): no hacking surface to the Zero-Nodes, integrate silicon route of trust
