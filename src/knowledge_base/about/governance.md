## Introduction

We introduce the ThreeFold governance and provide some context around ThreeFold in general.

## Project History

The project is grateful of the support of its community and the commercial entity TFTech.

ThreeFold is fundamentally a decentralized initiative. Within this framework, ThreeFold Dubai plays a pivotal role in championing and advancing the ThreeFold Grid and the broader movement.

For more information, read the [ThreeFold History](./threefold_history.md).

## Governance Process

To make sure that all our funds are used properly and that decisions are taken for the benefit of ThreeFold and its community as a whole, we make use of different tools and features, such as multi-signature wallets, the [ThreeFold DAO](./dao/tfdao.md) and the [ThreeFold Forum](https://forum.threefold.io/).

## Decentralized and Open-Source

In essence, ThreeFold is a decentralized and open-source project. We invite everyone to contribute and participate within the ThreeFold ecosystem. 

You can read the code on the [ThreeFold Tech GitHub repository](https://github.com/threefoldtech).
