## Introduction to TFT

ThreeFold tokens, or TFTs, are exclusively generated when new capacity is added to the TF Grid. There are no centralized issuers. Tokens have not been created out of thin air. 

While the ThreeFold Grid can expand, a maximum of 1 billion TFTs can ever be in circulation. This limit ensures stability of value and incentivization for all stakeholders. 

TFT lives on the Stellar Blockchain. TFT holders benefit from a big ecosystem of proven wallets and mediums of exchange. 

By employing Stellar technology, TFT transactions and smart contracts are powered by one of the most energy-efficient blockchains available. Furthermore, TFT is the medium of exchange on the greenest internet network in the world. The market for farming, cultivating and trading TFT is open to all. 

Anyone with internet connection, power supply and necessary hardware can become a Farmer or trade ThreeFold tokens (TFT). 

By farming, buying, holding, and utilizing ThreeFold Tokens, you are actively supporting the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid and its use cases — creating a more sustainable, fair, and equally accessible Internet.

## Proof-of-Capacity

ThreeFold uses proof-of-capacity to mint tokens. Since the genenis pool, all tokens that are being minted are the result of farming. Minting will stop during 2024, to keep the total amount of TFT at 1 billion, instead of the previously planned 4 billion. Read more about this [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/end-feb-2024-update-from-the-team/4233).

## Proof-of-Utilization

TFT is used on the TFGrid to purchase network, compute and storage resources through the proof-of-utilization protocol.

## TFT Distribution

The supply distribution of TFT is as follows:

| Supply Distribution | Qty (Millions) |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Total supply      | 942            |
| TF Foundation Supply      | 162            |
| Circulating supply  | 780          |
| Maximum supply      | 1000           |

The total supply of TFT is distributed as follows:

| Total Supply Distribution                | Qty (Millions) |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| TF Foundation: Ecosystem Grants                            | 22             |
| TF Foundation: Promotion & Marketing Effort                | 100            |
| TF Foundation:Ecosystem Contribution & Liquidity Exchanges | 40             |
| Genesis Pool & Farming Rewards             | 780            |

## TFT Marketcap and Market Price

The TFT market price and marketcap are as follows:

| **Description**           | **Value**     |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |
| TFT Market Price       | {{#include ../../../values/tft_value.md}} USD |
| TFT Market Cap | {{#include ../../../values/tft_marketcap.md}}  USD |

The market cap is equal to the product of the TFT market price and the circulating supply.

> Market Cap = (TFT Market Price) X (TFT Circulating Supply)

The values here are subject to change. Check the current market conditions.
