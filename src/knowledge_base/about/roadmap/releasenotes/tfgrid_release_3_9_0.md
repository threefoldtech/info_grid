### RMB-RS v1.0.2

Reliable Message Bus Relay (RMB-RS) is a secure communication panel that allows bots to communicate together in a chat-like way. It makes it very easy to host a service or a set of functions to be used by anyone, even if your service is running behind NAT.

- Guarantee authenticity of the messages. You are always sure that the received message is authentic from the sender.
- End-to-end encryption support.
- Support for third-party hosted Relays. Anyone can host a Relay and people can use it safely since there is no way messages can be inspected while using e2e. That's similar to home servers by matrix.

See [Specifications](https://github.com/threefoldtech/rmb-rs/blob/main/docs/readme.md) for more information.

### TFChain v2.3.0

On this release, we modified the twin objects on TFChain and removed the notion of an `IP`. We added 2 fields (`Relay` and `PK`) onto the twins.

- __Relay__: an RMB Relay Address which a client can connect to (See RMB changes)
- __PK__: a public key for an encryption key which can be used to encrypt messages on the Public Relay, if not set, traffic will be unencrypted.

__Impacted Clients:__

### TFChain-GraphQL v2.9.0

An important note for users, that multiple steps would be required to upgrade your TFChain-GraphQL into the latest v2.9.0 release, as described below:

1. Restart the ingester from scratch using the new config
