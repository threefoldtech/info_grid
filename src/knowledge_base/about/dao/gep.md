# Grid Enhancement Proposal

![](img/gep.png)

GEP stands for Grid Enhancement Proposal. A GEP is a design document providing information to the ThreeFold community, or describing a new feature for the TFGrid or its processes or environment. The GEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

- A GEP gets registered in TFChain. TFDAO makes this possible
- Community has to approve or not a GEP
- Once enough consensus achieved the GEP will be executed upon, whereas "consensus" is a variable % per GEP and will be defined when sepcs are ready.
- Validator Nodes of our L1 TFChain will make sure GEP is properly implemented and consensus also achieved on that level.
