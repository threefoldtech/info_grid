## Introduction

The ThreeFold Explorer serves as a powerful and intuitive tool within the ThreeFold Dashboard specifically designed to empower users in navigating and interacting with the ThreeFold Grid.

At its core, the TF Explorer is a comprehensive platform that enables users to discover nodes within the grid that align with their specific requirements, facilitating a seamless and efficient exploration of the decentralized network. Whether you are seeking computational resources, specific geographic locations, or specialized hardware configurations, the ThreeFold Explorer provides a user-friendly interface to effortlessly identify and connect with nodes that best suit your needs.

Throughout this manual, we will delve into the intricacies of the ThreeFold Explorer, highlighting key features, utilization strategies, and best practices for harnessing its capabilities effectively. 

## ThreeFold Explorer Links

The ThreeFold Explorer can give insights into the different ThreeFold networks. Each ThreeFold network has an associated ThreeFold Explorer. You can use the ThreeFold Explorer to query information about ThreeFold Statistics, Nodes and Farms. The links are the following:
