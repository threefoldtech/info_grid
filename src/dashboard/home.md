<h1> ThreeFold Dashboard </h1>

Explore, control, and manage your ThreeFold Grid resources effortlessly through our integrated Dashboard. Deploy solutions seamlessly while gaining full control, all within a unified interface.

The ThreeFold Dashboard is a revolutionary platform that simplifies the deployment process, allowing users to effortlessly interact with the TFGrid using intuitive web components known as weblets. 

## What is the ThreeFold Dashboard?

The ThreeFold Dashboard is a dynamic environment designed for both seasoned developers and newcomers alike. It offers a seamless and accessible browser experience, making it easy to deploy solutions on the TFGrid through the use of weblets. 

In the context of the Dashboard, a weblet is a compiled JavaScript web component that can be effortlessly embedded within the HTML page of a web application. This modular approach allows for flexible and intuitive interactions, facilitating a user-friendly deployment process.

The backend for the weblets is introduced with the [Javascript Client](../javascript/grid3_javascript_readme.md) which communicates to TFChain over RMB.
