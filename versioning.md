# Versions and branches

TFgrid uses semantic versioning (vx.y.z). Next to versions, There are also deployments ( most importantly mainnet and testnet).

The documentation of the currently deployed version on mainnet is on the master branch. To organize the documentation of upcoming releases version branches are used.

This means a planned grid version vx.y.z already has a branch x.y.z in this repository which is merged to master the moment vx.y.z is brought to mainnet.
