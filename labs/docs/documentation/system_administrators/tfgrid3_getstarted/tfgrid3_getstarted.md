# Getting Started

## Your First Deployment

It's easy to get started on the TFGrid. 

For your first deployment on the grid, we will show you how to deploy a full virtual machine running on a ThreeFold node.

- [Create a TFChain Account](../../dashboard/wallet_connector.md)
- [Get TFT](../../threefold_token/buy_sell_tft/buy_sell_tft.md)
- [Bridge TFT to TChain](../../threefold_token/tft_bridges/tft_bridges.md)
- [Deploy and Connect to a VM](ssh_guide/ssh_openssh)

Once you're acquainted with the basics, you can explore all types of ThreeFold deployments.
