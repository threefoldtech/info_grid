# TFT Associated Token Account on Solana

Before receiving TFT (Threefold Token) on Solana, you must create an Associated Token Account. This is essential for the Stellar-to-Solana bridge - without it, your transferred tokens might get stuck.

## TFT Mint Address

The official TFT mint address on Solana is:
```
TFTDVQ1mw85A79Zjeok5MQ1FNUQfgWd6FnPonApnrod
```

## Setting Up Your Associated Token Account

1. Open your wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
2. Find the option to add a custom token (usually a "+" button)
3. Enter the TFT mint address
4. Approve the transaction

## Important Notes

- **Cost:** Creating the account costs approximately 0.002 SOL (one-time fee)
- **SOL required:** Make sure you have at least 0.01 SOL in your wallet
- **Bridge requirement:** The Stellar-to-Solana bridge cannot create this account for you - it must exist before transferring
- **One-time setup:** Once created, you can receive TFT multiple times without creating another account
- **Verification:** Always use the official mint address shown above
