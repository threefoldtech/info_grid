# ThreeFold Web Gateway Architecture

## Introduction

ThreeFold's Web Gateway architecture represents a powerful bridge between the traditional IPv4 internet and the next-generation decentralized internet infrastructure built on Mycelium networking. Web gateways enable 3Nodes without public IPv4 addresses to provide publicly accessible services to internet users.

This guide explains the architectural concepts, use cases, and benefits of web gateways within the ThreeFold ecosystem.

## ThreeFold Grid Networking Architecture

ThreeFold Grid uses a multi-layer networking approach that enables secure, scalable communication between 3Nodes while providing public internet access through web gateways.

### Network Layer Breakdown

1. **IPv4/IPv6 Protocols**: Standard internet protocols for connectivity
2. **Mycelium Network**: IPv6 overlay network connecting all 3Nodes
3. **WireGuard Networks**: Private encrypted networks for workload isolation
4. **Web Gateway**: Protocol bridge enabling IPv4 internet access to IPv6 workloads

### Mycelium: Universal IPv6 Overlay Network

Mycelium is an open-source IPv6 overlay network that anyone can use on Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, and more. In ThreeFold Grid, it enables secure communication between 3Nodes.

#### Network Architecture:
- **Public Nodes as Servers**: Public backbone nodes act as servers/relays
- **All Participants as Clients**: Every device (including 3Nodes) connects as clients to public nodes
- **Public Node Mesh**: Public nodes connect to each other in a P2P mesh
- **Multiple Protocols**: Supports QUIC, TCP, and other communication methods

#### Core Capabilities:
- **Universal Connectivity**: Any device can join the Mycelium network
- **IPv6 Addressing**: Uses the 400::/7 IPv6 range for consistent addressing
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All traffic is encrypted by default
- **Cross-Platform**: Available on all major operating systems and mobile platforms
- **NAT-Friendly**: Reaches devices behind NAT using public node relays
- **Self-Healing**: Network automatically adapts to failures and topology changes

#### Future Development:
- **QUIC Hole Punching**: Direct P2P connections without relay nodes for NAT'd networks
- **Reduced Relay Dependency**: Direct communication between NAT'd devices

### WireGuard: Private Workload Networks

WireGuard provides private, encrypted networks for workload isolation and secure communication between specific nodes.

#### Network Architecture:
- **Gateway as Server**: Web gateways act as WireGuard servers
- **Nodes as Clients**: NAT'd 3Nodes connect as clients to the gateway
- **User Machines as Clients**: Your machine also connects as a client to access VMs
- **No Reverse Connections**: Gateway doesn't try to connect back to client machines

#### Key Features:
- **Private Networks**: Create isolated networks for specific workloads
- **Cross-Node Communication**: Secure communication between workloads on different 3Nodes
- **Additional Encryption**: Extra security layer on top of Mycelium
- **Flexible Topology**: Support for various network configurations
- **High Performance**: Minimal overhead for encrypted communication

#### Benefits:
- **Security**: Workload isolation and encrypted communication
- **Privacy**: Private networks separate from public Mycelium traffic
- **Flexibility**: Custom network topologies for complex applications
- **Scalability**: Efficient multi-node application architectures

## The Web Gateway Solution

**Key Problem**: If you host a workload on a 3Node without public IPv4 access, it's not reachable from the public internet.

**Web Gateway Solution**: Provides public IPv4 internet access to workloads that don't have public IPv4 connectivity.

### Why Web Gateways Are Needed

1. **Public Access**: Makes workloads accessible from the regular internet
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Public IPv4 addresses are expensive - only gateways need them
3. **Flexibility**: Deploy workloads on any 3Node regardless of network setup
4. **Simplicity**: End users access services normally via standard web browsers

## How Web Gateways Work

### Network Flexibility

ThreeFold Grid supports flexible network combinations:

- **IPv4 only**: Traditional internet connectivity
- **IPv6 only**: Using Mycelium network
- **Mycelium only**: Secure peer-to-peer communication
- **WireGuard only**: Private encrypted networks
- **IPv4 + Mycelium**: Public internet + secure overlay
- **IPv4 + WireGuard**: Public internet + private networks
- **IPv4 + IPv6 + Mycelium + WireGuard**: Full stack networking

### When You Need a Web Gateway

**Simple rule**: If your workload doesn't have public IPv4 access, but you want it reachable from the public internet, use a web gateway.

### How It Works

A Web Gateway is a 3Node with:
- **Public IPv4 address**: Accessible from the regular internet
- **Internal connectivity**: Can reach your workload via available networks (Mycelium, WireGuard, etc.)

The gateway acts as a **reverse proxy**, forwarding internet requests to your workload and returning responses.

### Traffic Flow Example

```mermaid

    participant User as üë§ Internet User
    participant GW as üåâ Web Gateway
    participant My as üçÑ Mycelium Network
    participant WG as üîí WireGuard Network
    participant App as üíª 3Node Workload
    
    User->>GW: HTTP Request (IPv4)
    Note over GW: Protocol Translation
    GW->>My: Forward Request (IPv6)
    My->>WG: Route to Workload Network
    WG->>App: Deliver to Application
    App->>WG: Application Response
    WG->>My: Return via Mycelium
    My->>GW: Response (IPv6)
    Note over GW: Protocol Translation
    GW->>User: HTTP Response (IPv4)
```

### Key Advantages

1. **Universal Access**: Any 3Node workload becomes publicly accessible
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Only gateway nodes need expensive public IPv4 addresses
3. **Network Flexibility**: Workloads can be deployed on any 3Node regardless of network setup
4. **Security**: All internal communication encrypted via Mycelium and WireGuard
5. **Scalability**: Multiple gateways can serve the same workloads for redundancy
