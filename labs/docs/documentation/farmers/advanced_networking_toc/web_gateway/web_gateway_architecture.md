# ThreeFold Web Gateway Architecture

## Introduction

ThreeFold's Web Gateway architecture represents a powerful bridge between the traditional IPv4 internet and the next-generation decentralized internet infrastructure built on Mycelium networking. Web gateways enable 3Nodes without public IPv4 addresses to provide publicly accessible services to internet users.

This guide explains the architectural concepts, use cases, and benefits of web gateways within the ThreeFold ecosystem.

## Network Architecture Overview

### The Three-Layer Network Stack

ThreeFold's networking architecture operates on three complementary layers:

    style D fill:#dc2626,stroke:#991b1b,stroke-width:3px,color:#ffffff
```

1. **IPv4 Layer**: Traditional internet connectivity for backward compatibility
2. **Mycelium Layer**: Advanced IPv6 overlay network for secure P2P communication
3. **Web Gateway Layer**: Bridge between IPv4 and Mycelium networks

### Mycelium: The Foundation Network

Mycelium is ThreeFold's revolutionary IPv6 overlay network that serves as the primary networking layer for 3Nodes:

#### Key Features:
- **IPv6 Addressing**: Uses the 400::/7 IPv6 range, providing virtually unlimited address space
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All traffic is encrypted by default between nodes
- **Identity-Based Networking**: Each node's IPv6 address is cryptographically linked to its private key
- **NAT Traversal**: Automatically establishes P2P connections without complex protocols
- **Locality-Aware Routing**: Intelligently finds the shortest path between nodes
- **Automatic Rerouting**: Self-healing network that adapts to failures and congestion
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No single points of failure or centralized control

#### Benefits Over Traditional Networks:
- **No NAT Issues**: Direct P2P communication without port forwarding
- **Built-in Security**: Encryption and authentication at the network layer
- **Global Scalability**: Can scale to billions of devices
- **Resilience**: Distributed routing with automatic failover
- **Privacy**: End-to-end encryption prevents traffic analysis

## Web Gateway Role and Function

### What is a Web Gateway?

A Web Gateway is a specialized 3Node that enables public internet access for workloads running on 3Nodes without public IPv4 addresses. It acts as a bridge between:
- **Internal**: 3Nodes without IPv4 addresses running workloads
- **External**: Public IPv4 internet users who need to access those workloads

```

### How Web Gateways Work

1. **Traffic Reception**: Gateway receives IPv4 requests from public internet users
2. **Protocol Translation**: Converts IPv4 requests to communicate with 3Nodes via Mycelium network
3. **Workload Routing**: Routes requests to target workloads on 3Nodes without public IPv4
4. **Response Handling**: Receives responses from workload 3Nodes and forwards back to internet users
5. **Load Balancing**: Can distribute traffic across multiple backend workloads on different 3Nodes

## Use Cases and Scenarios
