# Web Gateway

ThreeFold Web Gateways enable 3Nodes without public IPv4 addresses to provide publicly accessible services. They bridge the public IPv4 internet with 3Node workloads, eliminating the need for expensive public IP addresses on every node.

## Documentation

- [Digital Ocean Setup](./web_gateway_digital_ocean) - Step-by-step gateway deployment guide
- [Hetzner Setup](./web_gateway_hetzner) - Setup guide with current limitations noted
- [Web Gateway Architecture](./web_gateway_architecture) - Concepts, use cases, and technical architecture

## Key Benefits

- **Cost Efficiency**: Users deploy workloads without IPv4 requirements
- **Global Access**: Farmers with IPv4 provide gateway services worldwide
- **Secure Communication**: Internal traffic encrypted via Mycelium network
- **Flexible Architecture**: Workloads can be placed on optimal 3Nodes regardless of IP availability
