# Web Gateway

ThreeFold Web Gateways solve a simple problem for users: **if the workload doesn't have public IPv4 access, it's not reachable from the public internet**.

As a farmer, you can provide gateway services using your public IPv4 addresses, allowing users to deploy workloads on any 3Node while still **making them publicly accessible**.

Web gateways are 3Nodes with public IPv4 addresses that act as reverse proxies, making any workload on any 3Node accessible from the regular internet - regardless of the workload's network setup.

## Key Benefits

- **Public Internet Access**: Makes any workload accessible from the regular internet
- **Cost Efficiency**: Only gateways need expensive public IPv4 addresses
- **Network Flexibility**: Deploy workloads on any 3Node regardless of network setup
- **Global Availability**: Farmers worldwide provide gateway services
- **Simple Setup**: No complex networking configuration required
