<h1> Farming Troubleshooting </h1>

When building a 3Node, we advise to follow carefully the 6 steps laid out in the [3Node building](./3node_building/3node_building.md) section of the manual. Make sure that the disks are properly wiped, that you have the correct bootstrap image and that the BIOS/UEFI is set correctly.

If you are still having issues, you may find solutions to your issues by reading the sections [Build Troubleshooting](./farming_troubleshooting_tips.md#build-troubleshooting) and [Basic Post Build Troubleshooting](./farming_troubleshooting_tips.md#basic-post-build-troubleshooting).

If your issues are related to memory, the section [Memory Troubleshooting](./farming_troubleshooting_tips.md#memory-troubleshooting) should help.

If you still can't fix your issue, try to get more info by reading the Error/Log screen. Read the section [Advanced Post Build Troubleshooting](./farming_troubleshooting_tips.md#advanced-post-build-troubleshooting) for more information. 

Once you have more information via the Error/Log screen, you should first try to find fixes to the errors by reading the troubleshooting section. 

If you still can't find solutions to your issues, read the section [Get Further Assistance](./farming_troubleshooting_tips.md#get-further-assistance) to ask for help.
