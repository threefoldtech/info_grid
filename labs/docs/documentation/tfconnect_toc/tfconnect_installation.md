## Create Account

Once you've accepted the Terms and Conditions, you can either *Create Account* or *Log In*. For now, we will show how to create a new account. The login process is explained below.

To create a new account, you will be asked to choose a `Threefold Connect Id`. This ID will be used, as well as the seed phrase, when you want to log in after having logged out of your account.

You will also need to add a valid email address. You will need to access your email and confirm the validation email from ThreeFold to use properly the TF Connect app wallet.

You will be shown your seed phrase. Keep this in a secure and offline place. You will need the 3bot ID, i.e. the account `Name`, and the `Seed phrase` to recover your account. This seed phrase is of utmost importance. Do not lose it nor give it to anyone.

Once you've hit `Next`, you will be asked to write down 3 random words of your seed phrase. This is a necessary step to ensure you have taken the time to write down your seed phrase.

Then, you'll be asked to confirm your TF 3bot name and the associated email.

Finally, you will be asked to choose a 4-digit PIN. This will be needed to use the ThreeFold Connect app. If you ever forget this 4-digit PIN, you will need to recover your account using your account name and your seed phrase. You will need to confirm the new pin in the next step.

## Log Out

- To log out, click on `Log Out` in the `Settings` window.
