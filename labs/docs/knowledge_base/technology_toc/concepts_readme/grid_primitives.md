## Introduction

Within the ThreeFold Grid, we offer a range of __low-level constructs known as Primitives__. These powerful functionalities enable you to create diverse and customized solutions atop the grid, opening up a world of possibilities. It's important to note that any application compatible with Linux can seamlessly run on the ThreeFold Grid, ensuring maximum flexibility.

## Compute

Harness the power of computation with our compute primitives, measured in [compute units](../../cloud_toc/cloudunits) (CU).

- [ZKube](../primitives_toc/compute_toc/zkube): Deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters effortlessly.
- [ZMachine](../primitives_toc/compute_toc/zmachine): Run your applications within containers or virtual machines powered by the Zero-OS operating system.
- [CoreX](../primitives_toc/compute_toc/corex) (optional): Gain remote access to your ZMachine by utilizing the CoreX process manager.

## Storage

Leverage our robust storage Primitives, measured in [storage units](../../cloud_toc/cloudunits) (SU), to meet your data storage requirements efficiently.

- [ZOS Filesystem](../primitives_toc/storage_toc/zos_fs): Enjoy a deduplicated and immutable filesystem for secure and reliable data storage.
- [ZOS Mount](../primitives_toc/storage_toc/zmount): Utilize a portion of a high-speed SSD (Solid State Drive) as a mounted disk directly accessible within your ZMachine.
- [Quantum Safe Filesystem](../primitives_toc/storage_toc/qsfs): Secure your data with an unbreakable storage system, ideal for secondary storage needs.
- [Zero-DB](../primitives_toc/storage_toc/zdb): Experience a powerful key-value storage mechanism that serves as the foundation for other storage mechanisms.
- [Zero-Disk](../primitives_toc/storage_toc/zdisk) (OEM only): Employ a virtual disk format designed exclusively for original equipment manufacturers.

## Network

Harness our network Primitives, measured in [network units](../../cloud_toc/cloudunits) (CU), to enable seamless communication and connectivity.

- [ZNET](../primitives_toc/network_toc/znet): Establish private networks between ZMachines, ensuring secure and efficient communication.
- [ZNIC](../primitives_toc/network_toc/znic): Access and manage network interfaces within the Planetary Network, enabling efficient data transfer and communication.
- [WebGateway](../primitives_toc/network_toc/webgw3): Connect your ZNET to the internet with ease, facilitating seamless integration with the wider network.

## Zero-OS Advantages

Enjoy the [numerous advantages](../primitives_toc/zos_advantages) that Zero-OS brings to the table.

- [Zero Install](../primitives_toc/zos_advantages#zero-os-installation): Experience hassle-free deployment without the need for complex installations.
- [Unbreakable Storage](../primitives_toc/zos_advantages#unbreakable-storage): Ensure the integrity and security of your data with our robust storage mechanisms.
- [Zero Hacking Surface](../primitives_toc/zos_advantages#zero-hacking-surface): Benefit from a minimized attack surface, bolstering the security of your infrastructure.
- [Zero Boot](../primitives_toc/zos_advantages#zero-boot): Enjoy lightning-fast boot times, allowing for swift and efficient system initialization.
- [Deterministic Deployment](../primitives_toc/zos_advantages#deterministic-deployment): Achieve consistent and predictable deployments, streamlining your development process.
- [ZOS Protect](../primitives_toc/zos_advantages#zero-os-protect): Experience enhanced protection and security measures to safeguard your infrastructure.

## Conclusion

With these powerful Primitives and Zero-OS advantages, the ThreeFold Grid empowers you to build, scale, and secure your solutions with ease. Unleash your creativity and unlock limitless possibilities within the ThreeFold ecosystem.
