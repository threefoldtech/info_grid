## Advanced Method: Create a Pull Request

If you found an issue in the manual and you wish to fix the issue yourself, you can always fork the repository and propose the changes in a pull request. We present the main steps in this section as well as further details on how to proceed efficiently.



### Main Steps to Add Content

We present here the main steps to add content to the Threefold Manual by forking the repository [`threefoldtech/info_grid`](https://github.com/threefoldtech/info_grid) to your own Github account.

* Go to the Threefold Manual repository: [https://github.com/threefoldtech/info_grid](https://github.com/threefoldtech/info_grid)
* Fork the Development branch
  * On the top right corner, click `Fork -> Create a new fork`
* Make changes in the forked repository
   * To add a new section
      * Add a new Markdown file to the appropriate directory under `docs/`
      * Update the sidebar configuration in `sidebars.js` if needed
   * To modify an existing section:
     * Make the changes directly in the Markdown file
* Test your changes locally
  * Clone your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GIT_ACCOUNT/info_grid
    cd info_grid
    ```
  * Install dependencies and start the development server:
    ```bash
    make dev
    ```
  * The development server will start automatically at http://localhost:3000
  * Make changes and see them live-reload in your browser
* Ask for a pull request
  * In the forked repository, click `Contribute -> Open pull request`
* Once the pull request is accepted, the changes will be available on the live site

Note: You can update your forked repository by clicking `Sync fork -> Update branch`.
