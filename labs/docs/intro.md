# ThreeFold Labs

*Welcome to the ThreeFold Labs!*

> The ThreeFold Labs contain advanced material for users and farmers of the ThreeFold Grid. For basic information, please refer to the [Users](../users/intro) and [Farmers](../farmers/intro) sections respectively.

This manual is organized in two main sections: 

- [ThreeFold Knowledge Base](./knowledge_base/knowledge_base)
- [ThreeFold Documentation](./documentation/documentation)

The *ThreeFold Knowledge Base* section contains all information needed to understand how the whole ThreeFold ecosystem works. 

The *ThreeFold Documentation* section contains all the practical information of the ThreeFold Grid, from general information covering the multi-functional [ThreeFold Dashboard](./documentation/dashboard/dashboard), the versatile [ThreeFold Connect app](./documentation/tfconnect_toc/tfconnect_toc) and [TFT](./documentation/threefold_token/threefold_token), to specific tutorials for [developers](./documentation/developers/developers), [farmers](./documentation/farmers/farmers) and [system administrators](./documentation/system_administrators/system_administrators).

## Get Started

It's easy to get started on the ThreeFold Grid. 

If you want to farm TFT, check out [how to build a 3Node](./documentation/farmers/3node_building/3node_building). 

If you want to deploy or develop on the grid, you will first need to get TFT on TFChain:

- [Create a TFChain account](./documentation/dashboard/wallet_connector)
- Get TFT in your TFChain account
  - [Buy TFT](./documentation/threefold_token/buy_sell_tft/buy_sell_tft)
  - [Send TFT to TFChain](./documentation/threefold_token/tft_bridges/tft_bridges)

To develop on the Grid, read the [developers documentation](./documentation/developers/developers).

To deploy applications, read the [deploy section](./documentation/dashboard/deploy/deploy) then, if needed, [access the deployment via SSH](./documentation/system_administrators/tfgrid3_getstarted/ssh_guide/ssh_guide).
