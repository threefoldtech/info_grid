In this section, we cover the essential farming requirements when it comes to ThreeFold 3Node hardware.

## Hardware Requirements

You need a theoretical minimum of 500 GB of SSD and 2 GB of RAM on a mini pc, desktop or server. 

Also, note that ThreeFold runs its own OS, which is Zero-OS. You thus need to start with completely wiped disks. You cannot farm TFT with Windows, Linux or MAC OS installed on your disks. If you need to use such OS temporarily, boot it in Try mode with a removable media (USB key).

### 3Node Requirements Summary

Any computer with the following specifications can be used as a DIY 3Node.

- A wired ethernet connection is required.
- The router must be set with DHCP.
- Any 64-bit hardware with an Intel or AMD processor chip.
- A minimum of 500 GB of SSD and a bare minimum of 2 GB of RAM is required.
