To buy TFT, an easy way is to import your TF Connect wallet to Lobstr and buy TFT on Lobstr. Then, your TFT will be directly available on TF Connect. 

## Install Lobstr

Go on the [Lobstr website](https://www.lobstr.co) and download the Lobstr app.
You can download it for Android or iOS.

## Connect Your TF Connect App Wallet

You will then need to either create a new wallet or connect an existing wallet.

Since we are working with the Threefold ecosystem, it is very easy and practical to simply connect your TF Connect app wallet to Lobstr. This way, when you buy XLM and swap XLM tokens for TFTs, they will be directly available on your TF Connect app wallet.

To connect your TF Connect app wallet, you will need to find your Stellar address and chain secret key.
This is very simple to do.

Click on **I have a public or secret key**.

As you can see on this next picture, you need the Stellar address and secret key to properly connect your TF Connect app wallet to Lobstr:

Once this is done, simply paste this Stellar secret in the Lobstr app to import the wallet.

That's it! You've now connected your TF Connect app wallet to your Lobstr account.

## Buy XLM with Fiat Currency

Now, all we need to do, is buy XLM and then swap it for TFT.
It will be directly available in your TF Connect App wallet.

On the Lobstr app, click on the top right menu button:

Then, click on **Buy Crypto**:

By default, the crypto selected is XLM. This is alright for us as we will quickly swap the XLM for TFT.

On the Buy Crypto page, you can choose the type of Fiat currency you want.
By default it is in USD. To select some othe fiat currency, you can click on **ALL** and see the available fiat currencies:

You can search or select the current you want for the transfer:

You will then need to decide how much XLM you want to buy. Note that there can be a minimum amount.
Once you chose the desired amount, click on **Continue**.

Lobstr will then ask you to proceed to a payment method. In this case, it is Moonpay.
Note that in some cases, your credit card won't accept Moonpay payments. You will simply need to confirm with them that you agree with transacting with Moonpay. This can be done by phone. Check with your bank and credit card company if this applies.

Once you've set up your Moonpay payment method, you will need to process and confirm the transaction:

You will then see a processing window.
This process is usually fast. Within a few minutes, you should receive your XLM.

Once the XLM is delivered, you will receive a notification:

When your transaction is complete, you will see this message:

On the Trade History page, you can choose to download the csv file version of your transaction:

That's it! You've bought XLM on Lobstr and Moonpay.

## Swap XLM for TFT

Now we want to swap the XLM tokens for the Threefold tokens (TFT).
This is even easier than the previous steps.

Go to the Lobstr Home menu and select **Swap**:

On the **Swap** page, write "tft" and select the Threefold token:

Select the amount of XLM you want to swap. It is recommended to keep at least 1 XLM in your wallet for transaction fees.

Within a few seconds, you will receive a confirmation that your swap is completed:
Note that the TFT is directly sent on your TF Connect app wallet.
