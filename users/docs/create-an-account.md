- [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/3bot-login/id1459845885?l=nl&mt=8)

## Create an Account

To create a new account, you will be asked to choose a `Threefold Connect Id`. This ID will be used, as well as the seed phrase, when you want to log in after having logged out of your account.

You will also need to add a valid email address. You will need to access your email and confirm the validation email from ThreeFold to use properly the TF Connect app wallet.

You will be shown your seed phrase. Keep this in a secure and offline place. You will need the 3bot ID, i.e. the account `Name`, and the `Seed phrase` to recover your account. This seed phrase is of utmost importance. Do not lose it nor give it to anyone.
