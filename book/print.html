                        <h2 id="how-it-works"><a class="header" href="#how-it-works">How it works</a></h2>
<p>Here we will try to describe the platform in a nutshell, so we understand the mechanics and clear the terminology a little bit.</p>
<h3 id="capacity"><a class="header" href="#capacity">Capacity</a></h3>
<p>Threefold grid is providing the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/explorer/statistics">largest</a> decentralized, peer 2 peer infrastructure. </p>
<h3 id="the-process"><a class="header" href="#the-process">The process</a></h3>
<p>The idea is similar to electricity grid. People consume electricity, and sometimes they can provide electricity. It's almost the same. </p>
<h4 id="tfchain"><a class="header" href="#tfchain">TFchain</a></h4>
<p>TFChain is a blockchain orchestrating the interactions on the grid</p>
<ul>
<li>Users registration</li>
<li>Farms Managment (registration and IP management)</li>
<li>Money transfers</li>
<li>Billing and consumptions reports</li>
</ul>
<p>And more.</p>
<h4 id="the-farmers"><a class="header" href="#the-farmers">The farmers</a></h4>
<p>People (we call them farmers) provide internet capacity using one or mode 3Nodes. these nodes are registered on <code>TFChain</code> in what we call a &quot;farm&quot;. </p>
<p>The farm is the logical grouping of nodes. e.g you can have 2 3Nodes in Belgium, and 5 in France. so to logically group them you can create a farm in Belgium with a specific ID that you can use in for the nodes in Belgium and create another farm with another ID for the nodes in france. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: most of the time the grouping is also done by the physical place</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="3node"><a class="header" href="#3node">3Node</a></h4>
<p>it's a computer really. That 3Node runs a very specific software <code>zero-os</code> sometimes called <code>zos</code>. <code>Zero-OS</code> is an autonomous operating system designed to expose raw compute, storage and network capacity.</p>
<p>The <code>Zero-OS</code> handles 
-The workloads provisioning, e.g starting a new container or a VM, starting a <code>0-db</code>,</p>
<ul>
<li>The networking for the workloads</li>
<li>The lifecycle management of the workloads running on </li>
<li>The system upgrades</li>
<li>Consumption reporting for the billing to happen on the <code>TFChain</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="provisioning"><a class="header" href="#provisioning">Provisioning</a></h4>
<p>Now that's very cool, we now already know about <code>TFChain</code>, <code>Farmers</code>, <code>3Nodes</code> and <code>Zero-OS</code>, but still one major thing is still missing is how can we send a provisioning request to <code>Zero-OS</code>?</p>
<p>The provisioning process is done mainly using two tools which you can read about in this manual; </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="getstarted/../terraform/terraform_readme.html">Terraform</a></li>
<li><a href="getstarted/../javascript/grid3_javascript_readme.html">Typescript Client</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So what happens is we build the deployment information (what workloads we want to deploy) and create a contract(s) on the blockchain between us and a 3Node that will fulfill the provisioning of the resources needed in the contract for us, and automatically the node reports to the blockchain periodically to deduct the money from the user account based on the consumption.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we show you how to create a Threefold Connect account and wallet.</p>
<p>The main steps are simple and you will be done in no time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the Threefold Connect app</li>
<li>Create a Threefold Connect Account</li>
<li>Verify your Identity by Email (KYC)</li>
<li>Create a Threefold Connect Wallet</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="download-the-threefold-connect-app"><a class="header" href="#download-the-threefold-connect-app">Download the Threefold Connect App</a></h2>
<p>The Threefold Connect app is available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threefold-connect/id1459845885">iOS</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that for Android phones, you need at minimum Android 8.1</li>
<li>Note that for iOS phones, you need at minimum iOS 15</li>
</ul>
<p>Either use the links above, or search for the Threefold Connect app on the App Store or the Google Play Store. Then install and open the app. If you want to leave a 5-star review of the app, no one here will stop you!</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_1.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_1" />
<img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_2.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_2" /></p>
<p>When you try to open the app, if you get an error message such as: &quot;Error in initialization in Flagsmith...&quot;, you might need to upgrade your phone to a newer software version (Android 8.1 and iOS 15).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="create-a-threefold-connect-account"><a class="header" href="#create-a-threefold-connect-account">Create a Threefold Connect Account</a></h2>
<p>Once you are in the app, you will see some introduction pages to help you familiarize with the TF Connect app. You will also be asked to read and accept Threefold's Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_3.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_3" />
<img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_4.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_4" /></p>
<p>You will then be asked to either <em>SIGN UP</em> or <em>RECOVER ACCOUNT</em>. To create a new account, click <em>SIGN UP</em>.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_5.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_5" /></p>
<p>Then, choose a <em>Threefold Connect Id</em>. This 3bot ID will be used, as well as the seed phrase, when you want to recover an account. Choose wisely. And do not forget it! Here we will use TFExample, as an example.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_6.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_6" /></p>
<p>Next, you need to add a valid email address. This will be used as a broad KYC. You will need to access your email and confirm the Threefold validation email to fully use the Threefold Connect app.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_7.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_7" /></p>
<p>The next step is crucial! Make sure no one is around looking at your screen. You will be shown your seed phrase. Keep this in a secure and offline place. You will need the 3bot ID and the seed phrase to recover your account. This seed phrase is of utmost important. Do not lose it nor give it to anyone.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_8.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_8" /></p>
<p>Once you've hit <em>Next</em>, you will be asked to write down 3 random words of your seed phrase. This is a necessary step to ensure you have taken the time to write down your seed phrase.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_9.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_9" /></p>
<p>Then, you'll be asked to confirm your TF 3bot ID and the associated email.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_10.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_10" /></p>
<p>Finally, you will be asked to choose a 4-digit pin. This will be needed to use the Threefold Connect app. If you ever forget this 4-digit pin, you will need to recover your account from your 3bot name and your seed phrase. You will need to confirm the new pin in the next step.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_11.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_11" /></p>
<p>That's it! You've created your Threefold Connect account. You can press the hamburger menu on the top left to explore the Threefold Connect app.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_12.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_12" /></p>
<p>In the next step, we will create a Threefold Connect wallet. You'll see, it's very simple!</p>
<p>But first, let's see how the basic KYC works.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="verify-your-identity-by-email-kyc"><a class="header" href="#verify-your-identity-by-email-kyc">Verify Your Identity by Email (KYC)</a></h2>
<p>Once you've created your account, an email will be sent to the email address you've chosen in the account creation process. To verify your email, go on your email inbox and open the email sent by <em>info@openkyc.live</em> with the subject <em>Verify your email address</em>. </p>
<p>In this email, click on the link <em>Verify my email address</em>. This will lead you to a <em>login.threefold.me</em> link. The process should be automatic. Once this is done, you will receive a confirmation on screen, as well as on your phone.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_39.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_39" /></p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_40.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_40" /></p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_41.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_41" /></p>
<p>If, for some reason, you did not receive the verification email, simply click on <em>Verify</em> and another email will be sent.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_42.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_42" /></p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_43.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_43" /></p>
<p>That's it! You've now created a Threefold Connect account. </p>
<p>All that is left to do is to create a Threefold Connect wallet. This is very simple. </p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="create-a-threefold-connect-wallet"><a class="header" href="#create-a-threefold-connect-wallet">Create a Threefold Connect Wallet</a></h2>
<p>To create a wallet, click on the Threefold Connect app menu, then choose <em>Wallet</em>.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_13.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_13" /></p>
<p>Once you are in the section <em>Wallet</em>, click on <em>Create Initial Wallet</em>. If it doesn't work the first time, retry some more. If you have trouble creating a wallet, make sure your connection is reliable. You can try a couple of minutes later if it still doesn't work. With a reliable connection, there shouldn't be any problem. Contact TF Support if problems persist.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_14.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_14" /></p>
<p>This is what you see when the TF Grid is initializing your wallet.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_15.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_15" /></p>
<p>Once your wallet is initialized, you will see <em>No balance found for this wallet</em>. You can click on this button to enter the wallet.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_16.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_16" /></p>
<p>Once inside your wallet, this is what you see.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_17.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_17" /></p>
<p>We will now see where the Stellar and the TFChain addresses and secrets are to be found. We will also change the wallet name. To do so, click on the <em>encircled i</em> at the bottom right of the screen.</p>
<p>On this page, you can access your Stellar and TFChain addresses as well as your Stellar and TFChain secret keys.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_18.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_18" /></p>
<p>To change the name of your wallet, click on the button next to <em>Wallet Name</em>. Here we use TFWalletExample. Note that you can also use alphanumeric characters.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_19.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_19" /></p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_20.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_20" /></p>
<p>At the top of the section <em>Wallet</em>, we can see that the name has changed.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Connect/./img/farming_tf_wallet_21.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_21" /></p>
<p>That's it! You now have a Threefold Connect account and wallet.
This will be very useful for your TFT transactions on the Threefold ecosystem.</p>

<p>The Threefold token (TFT) is the utility token of the Threefold Grid, a decentralized and open-source project offering network, compute and storage capacity.</p>
<p>Threefold Tokens (TFT) are created (minted) by the ThreeFold Blockchain (TFChain) only when new Internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid by farmers. For this reason, TFT is a pure utility token as minting is solely the result of farming on the Threefold Grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To <strong>farm</strong> TFT, read the <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-farming-guide-part-1/2989">complete farming guide</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To <strong>buy</strong> TFT, follow this guide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways to buy TFT:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can buy TFT on <a href="https://lobstr.co/">Lobstr</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can buy TFT at <a href="https://gettft.com/gettft/">GetTFT.com</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can buy TFT on <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=BNB&amp;outputCurrency=0x8f0FB159380176D324542b3a7933F0C2Fd0c2bbf">Pancake Swap</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the current guide, we will show how to buy TFT on the <a href="https://lobstr.co/">Lobstr app</a>.
The process is simple.</p>
<p>Here are the main steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and Create an account</li>
<li>Connect to the TF Connect app wallet</li>
<li>Buy XLM</li>
<li>Swap XLM to TFT</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that it is possible to do these steps without connecting the Lobstr wallet to the TF Connect App wallet. But doing this has a clear advantage: when we buy and swap on Lobstr, the TFT is directly accessible on the TF Connect app wallet.</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="download-the-app-and-create-an-account"><a class="header" href="#download-the-app-and-create-an-account">Download the App and Create an Account</a></h2>
<p>Go on <a href="https://www.lobstr.co">www.lobstr.co</a> and download the Lobstr app.
You can download it for Android or iOS.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_1.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>We will show here the steps for Android, but it is very similar with iOS.
Once you've clicked on the Android button, you can click install on the Google Store page:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_2.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Once the app is downloaded, open it:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_3.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>On the Lobstr app, click on <strong>Create Account</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_4.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>You will then need to enter your email address:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_5.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Then, choose a safe password for your account:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_6.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Once this is done, you will need to verify your email.</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Verify Email</strong> and then go check your email inbox.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_7.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Simply click on <strong>Verify Email</strong> on the email you've received.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_8.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Once your email is verified, you can sign in to your Lobstr account:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_9.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_10.png" alt="image" /></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="connect-your-tf-connect-app-wallet"><a class="header" href="#connect-your-tf-connect-app-wallet">Connect Your TF Connect App Wallet</a></h2>
<p>You will then need to either create a new wallet or connect an existing wallet.</p>
<p>Since we are working on the Threefold ecosystem, it is very easy and practical to simply connect your Threefold Connect app wallet. You can also create a new wallet.</p>
<p>Using the TF Connect wallet is very useful and quick. When you buy XLM and swap XLM tokens for TFTs, they will be directly available on your TF Connect app wallet.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_11.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>To connect your TF Connect app wallet, you will need to find your Stellar address and chain secret key.
This is very simple to do.</p>
<p>Click on <strong>I have a public or secret key</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_12.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>As you can see on this next picture, you need the Stellar address and secret key to properly connect your TF Connect app wallet to Lobstr:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_18.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>To find your Stellar address and secret key, go on the TF Connect app and select the <strong>Wallet</strong> section:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_13.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>At the top of the section, click on the <strong>copy</strong> button to copy your Stellar Address:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_17.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Now, we will find the Stellar secret key.
At the botton of the section, click on the encircled <strong>i</strong> button:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_14.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Next, click on the <strong>eye</strong> button to reveal your secret key:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_15.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>You can now simply click on the <strong>copy</strong> button on the right:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_16.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>That's it! You've now connected your TF Connect app wallet to your Lobstr account.</p>
<h2 id="buy-xlm-with-fiat-currency"><a class="header" href="#buy-xlm-with-fiat-currency">Buy XLM with Fiat Currency</a></h2>
<p>Now, all we need to do, is buy XLM and then swap it for TFT.
It will be directly available in your TF Connect App wallet.</p>
<p>On the Lobstr app, click on the top right menu button:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_19.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Then, click on <strong>Buy Crypto</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_20.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>By default, the crypto selected is XLM. This is alright for us as we will quickly swap the XLM for TFT.</p>
<p>On the Buy Crypto page, you can choose the type of Fiat currency you want.
By default it is in USD. To select some othe fiat currency, you can click on <strong>ALL</strong> and see the available fiat currencies:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_21.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>You can search or select the current you want for the transfer:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_22.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>You will then need to decide how much XLM you want to buy. Note that there can be a minimum amount.
Once you chose the desired amount, click on <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_23.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Lobstr will then ask you to proceed to a payment method. In this case, it is Moonpay.
Note that in some cases, your credit card won't accept Moonpay payments. You will simply need to confirm with them that you agree with transacting with Moonpay. This can be done by phone. Check with your bank and credit card company if this applies.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_24.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Once you've set up your Moonpay payment method, you will need to process and confirm the transaction:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_25.png" alt="image" />
<img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_26.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>You will then see a processing window.
This process is usually fast. Within a few minutes, you should receive your XLM.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_27.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Once the XLM is delivered, you will receive a notification:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_28.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>When your transaction is complete, you will see this message:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_29.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>On the Trade History page, you can choose to download the csv file version of your transaction:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_30.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>That's it! You've bought XLM on Lobstr and Moonpay.</p>
<h2 id="swap-xlm-for-tft"><a class="header" href="#swap-xlm-for-tft">Swap XLM for TFT</a></h2>
<p>Now we want to swap the XLM tokens for the Threefold tokens (TFT).
This is even easier than the previous steps.</p>
<p>Go to the Lobstr Home menu and select <strong>Swap</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_31.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>On the <strong>Swap</strong> page, write &quot;tft&quot; and select the Threefold token:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_32.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Select the amount of XLM you want to swap. It is recommended to keep at least 1 XLM in your wallet for transaction fees.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_33.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Within a few seconds, you will receive a confirmation that your swap is completed:
Note that the TFT is directly sent on your TF Connect app wallet.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Token/./img/gettft_34.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>That's it. You've swapped XLM for TFT.</p>
<p>You can now use your TFT to deploy workloads on the Threefold Grid.</p>

<p>For this section, we will create an account on the TFChain and transfer TFT from Stellar chain to TFChain. We will then be able to use the TFT and deploy workloads on the Threefold Playground.</p>
<p>It is simple. The main steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Threefold Dashboard</li>
<li>Download the Polkadot extension</li>
<li>Create an account</li>
<li>Send TFT from Stellar Chain to TFChain</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-polkadot-extension-account"><a class="header" href="#create-polkadot-extension-account">Create Polkadot Extension Account</a></h2>
<p>Go to the Threefold Dashboard: https://dashboard.grid.tf/</p>
<p>If you don't have the Polkadot extension installed on your browser, you will be able to click on the download link directly on the Threefold Dashboard page:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_1.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>This link will lead you to the Polkadot extension download page: https://polkadot.js.org/extension/</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_2.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Then, simply click on &quot;Add to Chrome&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_3.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Then, confirm by clicking on &quot;Add extension&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_4.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>You can now access the extension by clicking on the browser's extension button on the top right of the screen, and by then clicking on <em>polkadot{.js} extension</em>:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_5.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Make sure to carefully read the Polkadot message then click on <strong>Understood, let me continue</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_6.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Then click on the <strong>plus</strong> symbol to create a new account:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_7.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>For this next step, you should be very careful. Your seed phrase is your only access to your account. Make sure to keep a copy somewhere safe and offline.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_8.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>After, choose a name for your account and a password:</p>

<p>Your account is now created. You can see it when you open the Polkadot extension on your browser:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_10.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Now, when you go on the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a>, you can click on the <strong>Connect</strong> button on the top right corner:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_11.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>You will then need to grant the Threefold Dashboard access to your Polkadot account.</p>
<p>Accept the terms and then write your password to confirm:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_12.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_13.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Then, simply click on your account name to access the Threefold Dashboard:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_14.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Once you open your account, you can create a Twin ID. Make sure it is written <strong>::1</strong> in the box and click <strong>Create</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_15.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>You will also be asked to confirm the transaction.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_13.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>That's it! You've successfully created an account on the TFChain thanks to the Polkadot extension. You can now access the Threefold Dashboard.</p>
<p>On to the next section! Where we will transfer (or swap) TFT from the Stellar Chain on your Threefold Connect app wallet to the TFChain on the Threefold Dashboard.</p>
<p>You'll see, this is so easy thanks to the Threefold Dashboard configuration.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="transfer-tft-from-stellar-chain-to-tfchain"><a class="header" href="#transfer-tft-from-stellar-chain-to-tfchain">Transfer TFT from Stellar Chain to TFChain</a></h2>
<p>On the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a>, click on the <strong>Portal</strong>, then click on <strong>Swap</strong>.</p>
<p>Make sure the chain <strong>stellar</strong> is selected. Then click <strong>Deposit</strong>, as we want to deposit TFT from the Stellar Chain to the TFChain.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_16.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Next, you will scan the QR code shown on the screen with the Threefold Connect app.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that you can also manually enter the Stellar Chain address and the Twin ID.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_17.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>To scan the QR code on the Threefold Connec app, follow those steps:</p>
<p>Click on the menu button:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_18.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Click on <strong>Wallet</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_19.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Then, click on <strong>Send Coins</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_20.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>On the next page, select the <strong>Stellar</strong> chain, then click on <strong>SCAN QR</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_21.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>This will automatically write the correct address and twin ID.</p>
<p>You can now write the amount of TFT you wish to send, and then click <strong>SEND</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recommend to try with a small amount of TFT first to make sure everything is OK.</p>
<p>The transfer fees are of 1 TFT per transfer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_22.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>You will then simply need to confirm the transaction. It is a good opportunity to make sure everything is OK.</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_23.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>You should then receive your TFT on your Dashboard account within a few minutes.</p>
<p>You can see your TFT balance on the top of the screen. Here's an example of what it could look like:</p>
<p><img src="getstarted/TF_Dashboard/./img/dashboard_24.png" alt="image" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: You might need to refresh (reload) the webpage to see the new TFT added to the account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's it! You've swapped TFT from Stellar Chain to TFChain.</p>

<p>Threefold loves Open Source! In v3.0 we are integrating one of the most popular 'Infrastructure as Code' (IaC) tools of the cloud industry, <a href="https://terraform.io">Terraform</a>. Utilizing the Threefold grid v3 using Terraform gives a consistent workflow and a familiar experience for everyone coming from different background. Terraform describes the state desired of how the deployment should look like instead of imperatively describing the low level details and the mechanics of how things should be glued together.</p>
<h2 id="features"><a class="header" href="#features">Features</a></h2>

They need to do the capacity planning. Check <a href="terraform/resources/../../dashboard/explorer/explorer_home.html">Exploring Capacity</a> to know which nodes fits your deployment criteria.</li>
<li><code>network_name</code> which network to deploy our project on, and here  we choose the <code>name</code> of network <code>net1</code></li>
<li><code>ip_range</code> here we <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/functions/lookup.html">lookup</a> the iprange of node <code>2</code> and initially load it with <code>&quot;&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Advannced note: Direct map access fails during the planning if the key doesn't exist which happens in cases like adding a node to the network and a new deployment on this node. So it's replaced with this to make a default empty value to pass the planning validation and it's validated anyway inside the plugin.</p>

<img src="terraform/resources/./terraform/img//graphql_publicconf.png" alt=" " /></p>
<p>Here </p>
<ul>
<li>we created a grid domain resource <code>ashraf</code> to be deployed on gateway node <code>7</code> to end up with a domain <code>ashraf.ghent01.devnet.grid.tf</code></li>
<li>we create a proxy for the gateway to send the traffic coming to <code>ashraf.ghent01.devnet.grid.tf</code> to the vm as a backend, we say <code>tls_passthrough is false</code> to let the gateway terminate the traffic, if you replcae it with <code>true</code> your backend service needs to be able to do the TLS termination</li>

<h1 id="terraform-caprover"><a class="header" href="#terraform-caprover">Terraform Caprover</a></h1>
<h3 id="what-is-caprover"><a class="header" href="#what-is-caprover">What is CapRover?</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://caprover.com/">CapRover</a> is an easy-to-use app/database deployment and web server manager that works for a variety of applications such as Node.js, Ruby, PHP, Postgres, and MongoDB. It runs fast and is very robust, as it uses Docker, Nginx, LetsEncrypt, and NetData under the hood behind its user-friendly interface.
Here’s a link to CapRover's open source repository on <a href="https://github.com/caprover/caprover">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3 id="features-of-caprover"><a class="header" href="#features-of-caprover">Features of Caprover:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>CLI for automation and scripting</li>
<li>Web GUI for ease of access and convenience</li>
<li>No lock-in: Remove CapRover and your apps keep working !</li>
<li>Docker Swarm under the hood for containerization and clustering.</li>
<li>Nginx (fully customizable template) under the hood for load-balancing.</li>
<li>Let’s Encrypt under the hood for free SSL (HTTPS).</li>
<li><strong>One-Click Apps</strong> : Deploying one-click apps is a matter of seconds! MongoDB, Parse, MySQL, WordPress, Postgres and many more.</li>
<li><strong>Fully Customizable</strong> : Optionally fully customizable nginx config allowing you to enable HTTP2, specific caching logic, custom SSL certs and etc.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster Ready</strong> : Attach more nodes and create a cluster in seconds! CapRover automatically configures nginx to load balance.</li>
<li><strong>Increase Productivity</strong> : Focus on your apps ! Not the bells and whistles, just to run your apps.</li>
<li><strong>Easy Deploy</strong> : Many ways to deploy. You can upload your source from dashboard, use command line caprover deploy, use webhooks and build upon git push</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pre-requisites"><a class="header" href="#pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Domain Name:
after installation, you will need to point a wildcard DNS entry to your CapRover IP Address.
Note that you can use CapRover without a domain too. But you won't be able to setup HTTPS or add <code>Self hosted Docker Registry</code>.</li>
<li>TerraForm installed to provision, adjust and tear down infrastructure using the tf configuration files provided here.</li>
<li>Yggdrasil installed and enabled for End-to-end encrypted IPv6 networking.</li>
<li>account created on <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://tfchain.dev.threefold.io/ws#/accounts">Polkadot</a> and got an twin id, and saved you mnemonics.</li>
<li>TFTs in your account balance (in development, Transferer some test TFTs from ALICE account).</li>

<h5 id="step-2-connect-root-domain"><a class="header" href="#step-2-connect-root-domain">Step 2: Connect Root Domain</a></h5>
<p>After the container runs, you will now need to connect your CapRover instance to a Root Domain.</p>
<p>Let’s say you own example.com. You can set *.something.example.com as an A-record in your DNS settings to point to the IP address of the server where you installed CapRover. To do this, go to the DNS settings in your domain provider website, and set a wild card A record entry.</p>
<p>For example: Type: A, Name (or host): *.something.example.com, IP (or Points to): <code>110.122.131.141</code> where this is the IP address of your CapRover machine.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">TYPE: A record
HOST: \*.something.example.com
POINTS TO: (IP Address of your server)
TTL: (doesn’t really matter)
</code></pre>
<p>To confirm, go to https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx and enter <code>somethingrandom.something.example.com</code> and check if IP address resolves to the IP you set in your DNS.</p>
<h6 id="note"><a class="header" href="#note">Note</a></h6>
<p><code>somethingrandom</code> is needed because you set a wildcard entry in your DNS by setting <code>*.something.example.com</code> as your host, not <code>something.example.com</code>.</p>
<h5 id="step-3-caprover-root-domain-configurations"><a class="header" href="#step-3-caprover-root-domain-configurations">Step 3: CapRover Root Domain Configurations</a></h5>
<p>skip this step if you provided your root domain in the TerraFrom configuration file</p>
<p>Once the CapRover is initialized, you can visit <code>http://[IP_OF_YOUR_SERVER]:3000</code> in your browser and login to CapRover using the default password <code>captain42</code>. You can change your password later.</p>
<p>In the UI enter you root domain and press Update Domain button.</p>
<h5 id="step-4-access-the-captain-dashboard"><a class="header" href="#step-4-access-the-captain-dashboard">Step 4: Access the Captain Dashboard</a></h5>
<p>Once you set your root domain as caprover.example.com, you will be redirected to captain.caprover.example.com.</p>
<p>Now CapRover is ready and running in a single node.</p>

<p>grid 3 client supports communication over RMB <code>MessageBusClient</code> or HTTP <code>HTTPMessageBusClient</code> using one of the deployed grid3 proxies.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">import fs from &quot;fs&quot;;
import path from &quot;path&quot;;
import { GridClient } from &quot;../src/client&quot;;

import { MessageBusClientInterface } from &quot;ts-rmb-client-base&quot;;
import { HTTPMessageBusClient } from &quot;ts-rmb-http-client&quot;;
import { MessageBusClient } from &quot;ts-rmb-redis-client&quot;;

</code></pre>
<p>So according to your scenario you choose the communication method</p>
<h2 id="example-configuration-object"><a class="header" href="#example-configuration-object">example configuration object</a></h2>
<pre><code class="language-json">{

    &quot;rmb_proxy&quot;: true,
    &quot;storeSecret&quot;: &quot;secret&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>So all configurations that is needed are</p>
<ul>
<li>network: <code>dev</code> for devnet, <code>test</code> for testnet</li>
<li>mnemonics</li>
<li>rmb_proxy: to use the https RMB proxy to reduce the dependencies on having <code>redis</code> and <code>yggrassil</code> on the same host, and also to be usable too from the browser if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-a-client"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-client">creating a client</a></h2>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">async function getClient(): Promise&lt;GridClient&gt; {

    return gridClient;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The grid client requires a communication transport, the availlable options are <code>MessageBusClient</code> that works over the RMB, and <code>HTTPMessageBusClient</code> using relay proxies </p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTTPMessageBusClient is very highlevel, and allows easier integration with many languages because it's http based, also it enables the whole space of web applications. It's safe to assume that we will be using it from now on.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>communication transport: RMB or over RMB proxy via HTTP</li>
<li>network: <code>dev</code> for devnet, <code>test</code> for testnet</li>
<li>mnemonics: used for signing the requests.</li>
<li>storeSecret: used to encrypt data while storing in backeds</li>
<li>BackendStorage : can be <code>auto</code> which willl automatically adapt if running in node environment to use <code>filesystem backend</code> or the browser enviornment to use <code>localstorage backend</code>. Also you can set it to <code>kvstore</code> to use the tfchain keyvalue store module.</li>
<li>keypairType: is defaulted to <code>sr25519</code>, most likely you will never need to change it. <code>ed25519</code> is supported too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The choice of the node is completely up to the user at this point. They need to do the capacity planning. Check <a href="javascript/../dashboard/explorer/explorer_home.html">Exploring Capacity</a> to know which nodes fits your deployment criteria.</p>

<p>Weblets are a UI tool helps to deploy solutions on TF Grid v3.</p>
<p>A weblet is a compiled javascript web component which can be embedded in HTML page of a web app.</p>
<p>The backend for the weblets is introduced with <a href="weblets/../javascript/grid3_javascript_readme.html">grid client</a> which communicate to TF Chain and TF Grid over RMB.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a non-code easy way to deploy a whole solution on the Grid.</li>
<li>It is 100% decentralized, there is no server involved</li>
</ul>

<p>Kubernetes is the standard container orchestration tool.</p>
<p>On the TF grid, Kubernetes clusters can be deployed out of the box. We have implemented <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3S</a>, a full-blown Kubernetes offering that uses only half of the memory footprint. It is packaged as a single binary and made more lightweight to run workloads in resource-constrained locations (fits e.g. IoT, edge, ARM workloads).</p>

<li><code>Cluster Token</code>: It's used for authentication between your worker nodes and master node. You could use the auto-generated one or type your own.</li>
<li><code>Network Name</code>: It's used for Wireguard's private network.</li>
<li><code>Network IP Range</code>: It's a private subnet for Wireguard's network. You could use the auto-generated one or replace it with a <strong>private</strong> subnet.</li>

<p><img src="weblets/./img/new_cap1.png" alt=" " /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select a capacity package:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum</strong>: {cpu: 1, memory: 1024, diskSize: 50 }</li>
<li><strong>Standard</strong>: {cpu: 2, memory: 1024 * 2, diskSize: 100 }</li>
<li><strong>Recommended</strong>: {cpu: 4, memory: 1024 * 4, diskSize: 250 }</li>
<li>Or choose a <strong>Custom</strong> plan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a node to deploy Caprover on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either use the <strong>Capacity Filter</strong>. Which simply lets you pick a <em>Farm</em> and <em>Country</em>, after clicking on <em>Apply filters and suggest nodes</em> then it lists available nodes with these preferences and you pick. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or use <strong>Manual</strong> and type a specific node number to deploy on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be very careful about the domain name: it needs to be a wildcard domain name you can configure in your chosen domain name system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Deployment will take couple of minutes.</p>
<h3 id="the-domain-name"><a class="header" href="#the-domain-name">The Domain Name</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>e.g. I picked <code>apps.openly.life</code> which is a domain name that will point to the ip address of the CapRover instance (which we only know after deployment).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="weblets/./img/domain_name_caprover_config.png" alt=" " /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note how the *.apps.openly.life points to the public IPv4 address that has been returned from the deployment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-to-know-what-the-ip-address-is"><a class="header" href="#how-to-know-what-the-ip-address-is">How to know what the IP address is?</a></h3>
<p>Go back to your CapRover weblet and go to the deployment list. Click on <code>Show Details</code>.</p>
<p><img src="weblets/./img/caprover_detail_weblet.png" alt=" " /></p>
<ul>
<li>The public IPv4 address is visible in here</li>

<p>The add IP option is for farmers that have a block of IP addresses routed to their router. This is mainly for data centers, but some ISP can provide this service for residential locations. With such public IP addresses, your TF farm and/or your 3nodes can present “dedicated IP” addresses for deployments.
Unless you are paying for a block of IPs, you only have one static IP which is needed for you router</p>
<p>The <a href="https://simulator.grid.tf/">Threefold simulator</a> is referring to this IP address. Only check the Public IP option in the simulator if you have such block of IP addresses.</p>

<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_createfarm_24.png" alt="Farming_Create_Farm_24" /> </p>
<p>For older systems, run the bootstrap in BIOS mode. For BIOS CD/DVD, choose <strong>ISO</strong>. For BIOS USB, choose <strong>USB</strong></p>
<p>Download the bootstrap image. Next, we will burn the bootstrap image.</p>
<hr />

<hr />
<h4 id="usb-key-biosuefi"><a class="header" href="#usb-key-biosuefi">USB Key BIOS+UEFI</a></h4>
<p>For <strong>MAC</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong> and <strong>Windows</strong>, you can use <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">BalenaEtcher</a> to load/flash the image on a USB stick. This program also formats the USB in the process. This will work for the option <strong>EFI IMG</strong> for UEFI boot, and with the option <strong>USB</strong> for BIOS boot. Simply follow the steps presented to you and make sure you select the bootstrap image file you downloaded previously.</p>
<p>General Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download BalenaEtcher</li>
<li>Open BalenaEtcher</li>
<li>Select <strong>Flash from file</strong></li>
<li>Find and select the bootstrap image (with your correct farm ID)</li>
<li>Select <strong>Target</strong> (your USB key)</li>
<li>Select <strong>Flash</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. Now you have a bootstrap image on Zero-OS as a bootable removable media device.</p>
<hr />
<p>For the BIOS <strong>USB</strong> and the UEFI <strong>EFI IMG</strong> images, with Linux, you will want to do:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dd status=progress if=FILELOCATION.ISO(or .IMG) of=/dev/sd*.
</code></pre>
<p>Here the * is to indicate that you must adjust according to your disk. To see your disks, write lsblk in the command window. Make sure you select the proper disk!</p>
<p>*If you USB key is not new, make sure that you format it before burning the Zero-OS image.</p>
<hr />
<p>For Windows, if you are using the <em><strong>&quot;dd&quot; able image</strong></em>, instead of writing command line, you can use the free USB flashing program called <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/rufus.mirror/">Rufus</a> and it will automatically do this with no need for Linux or command line. Rufus also formats the boot media in the process.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-requirements"><a class="header" href="#hardware-requirements">Hardware Requirements</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>In this section, we cover the essential farming requirements when it comes to Threefold 3node hardware.</p>
<p>You need a theoretical minimum of 500 GB of SSD and 2 GB of RAM on a mini pc, desktop or server. In short, for peak optimization, aim for 100 GB of SSD and 8GB of RAM per thread. (Thread is equivalent to virtual core or logical core.)</p>
<p>Also, TFDAO might implement a farming parameter based on <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_list.php">passmark</a>. From the ongoing discussion on the Forum, you should aim at a CPU mark of 1000 and above per core.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3node optimal farming hardware ratio -&gt; 100 GB of SSD + 8 GB of RAM per Virtual Core</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that you can run Zero-OS on a Virtual Machine (VM), but you won't farm any TFT from this process. To farm TFT, Zero-OS needs to be on bare metal.</p>
<p>Also, note that Threefold runs its own OS, which is Zero-OS. You thus need to start with completely wiped disks. You cannot farm TFT with Windows, Linux or MAC OS installed on your disks. If you need to use such OS temporarily, boot it in Try mode with a removable media (USB key).</p>
<p>Note: Once you have the necessary hardware, you need to <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide//farming/farming.html#1-create-a-farm">create a farm</a>, <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide//farming/farming.html#2-create-a-zero-os-bootstrap-image">create a Zero-OS bootstrap image</a>, <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide//farming/farming.html#4-wipe-all-the-disks">wipe your disks</a> and <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide//farming/farming.html#5-set-the-bios">set the BIOS/UEFI</a> .

<p><strong>3NODE REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Any computer with the following specifications can be used as a DIY 3node.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any 64-bit hardware with an Intel or AMD processor chip.</li>
<li>Servers, desktops and mini computers type hardware are compatible.</li>
<li>A minimum of 500 GB of SSD and a bare minimum of 2 GB of RAM is required.</li>
<li>A ratio of 100GB of SSD and 8GB of RAM per thread is recommended.</li>
<li>A wired ethernet connection is highly recommended to maximize reliability and the ability to farm TFT.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.passmark.com/">passmark</a> of 1000 per core is recommended and will probably be a minimum requirement in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>*A passmark of 1000 per core is recommend and will be a minimum requirement in the future. This is not yet an official requirement. A 3node with less than 1000 passmark per core of CPU would not be penalized if it is registered before the DAO settles the <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/cpu-benchmarking-for-reward-calculations/2479">Passmark Question</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bandwidth-requirements"><a class="header" href="#bandwidth-requirements">Bandwidth Requirements</a></h3>
<!---
This section should be checked and validated with the TF Team. We can change the constant (here it's 10) if needed. Or use another equation if this one is deemed suboptimal. This equation is an attempt at a synthesis of the discussions we had on the TF Forum.
-->
<hr />
<p>A 3node connects to the Threefold Grid and transfers information, whether it is in the form of compute, storage or network units (CU, SU, NU respectively). The more resources your 3nodes offer to the Grid, the more bandwidth will be needed to transfer the additional information. In this section, we cover general guidelines to make sure you have enough bandwidth on the Threefold Grid when utilization will be happening.</p>
<p>Note that the TFDAO will need to discuss and settle on clearer guidelines in the near future. For now, we propose those general guidelines. Being aware of these numbers as you build and scale your Threefold farm will set you in the proper direction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The strict minimum for one Titan is 1 mbps of bandwidth</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to expand your Threefold farm, you should check the following to make sure your bandwidth will be sufficient when there will be Grid utilization.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bandwidth per 3node Equation</strong></p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>min Bandwidth per 3node (mbps) = 10 * max((Total SSD TB / 1 TB),(Total Threads / 8 Threads),(Total GB / 64 GB)) + 10 * (Total HDD TB / 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This equation means that for each TB of HDD you need 5 mbps of bandwidth, and for each TB of SSD, 8 Threads and 64GB of RAM (whichever is higher), you need 10 mbps of bandwidth. </p>
<p>This means a proper bandwidth for a Titan would be 10 mbps. As stated, 1 mbps is the strict minimum for one Titan.</p>

<hr />
<p>From the data collected by the Threefold DIY Farming Community, we can list some common 3node builds. Note that these builds can be used as starting inspiration to build your own unique 3node! That's the beauty of <em>the TF 3node DIY Adventure</em>.</p>
<p>Building a 3node depends a lot on the hardware accessibility in your specific location. Do your own research and check what are the best deals when it comes to buying computers and parts where you live.</p>
<p>We regroup the 3node builds in 5 main categories:</p>

<p><strong>Lenovo M900 Tiny</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lenovo M900 Tiny</li>
<li>Intel Core i7-6700T CPU (8 Threads)</li>
<li>CPU Passmark per Core: 1817.75</li>
<li>1TB SSD</li>
<li>Crucial 64GB RAM CT2K32G4SFD8266 (2x32GB) DDR4 2666 MHz CL19 Laptop Memory</li>
</ul>
<p>A common Mini PC is the Lenovo M900 tiny. Equipped with an i7-6700T CPU (or i7-6700), this 3node can have up to 64GB of RAM. Note that for a i7-6500 and below, the maximum is 32GB of RAM.</p>
<p>For this DIY 3node, you usually need to buy the RAM and SSD separately to get the best price. Here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AmDJYWWS5M">amazing TF video</a> to get you started on this 3node DIY journey.</p>

<li>CPU Passmark per Core: 1300</li>
<li>32GB Ram</li>
<li>1x 512GB SSD</li>
</ul>
<p>This 3node is a great way to start your Threefold adventure: it requires no upgrade or any hardware tweaking. </p>
<p>It has the minimum SSD requirement as well as 32GB of RAM. This SSD/RAM ratio optimizes the farming reward. In short, for around 240$, you can farm around 257 TFT per month. With the current TFT price of 8 cents, this gives you a return on investment of less than 12 months. Building the New Internet isn't that hard after all!</p>

<li>32GB DDR3 RAM</li>
<li>1TB SSD Hard Drive</li>
<li>Zero-OS boot mode: UEFI</li>
</ul>
<p>This model has a nice CPU Passmark ratio and has the same basic specs as a Titan. A great advantage of this model is that you can buy it as is, wipe the disk and plug in your bootstrap image and that's it, you're farming TFT! It's thus an excellent first DIY 3node. </p>
<p>This build can be upgraded to 64GB of RAM, but it requires SODIMM RAM, which can be expenseive. DYOR.</p>

<p>A Tower Server DIY 3node is a good way to get major TFT rewards while also having an ergonomic and quiet 3node. Note that the Rack Server DIY 3node are usually louder, due to the fans spinning.</p>
<p>Building tower servers as DIY 3nodes is also has a clear advantage: when GPU will be available on TF Grid, you will have ample room to add a decent GPU. This is thus future-proof in that regard.</p>

<p>This 3node build by @Valentine969 is quite amazing. You get great TFT rewards in a 2U rack server. </p>
<p>Note that 2U servers are quieter than 1U. The reason is simple, 2U servers have larger fans, thus they can move more volume of air with a slower speed than would 1U fans. This is a general statement and it depends on the specific hardware.</p>

<h4 id="surge-protector"><a class="header" href="#surge-protector">Surge Protector</a></h4>
<p>A surge protector is highly recommended for your farm and your 3nodes. This ensures your 3nodes will not overcharge if a power surge happens. Whole-house surge protectors are also an option.</p>

<h4 id="power-distribution-unit-pdu"><a class="header" href="#power-distribution-unit-pdu">Power Distribution Unit (PDU)</a></h4>
<p>A PDU (power distribution unit) is useful in big server settings in order to manage your wattage and keep track of your power consumption.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="uninterrupted-power-supply-ups"><a class="header" href="#uninterrupted-power-supply-ups">Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS)</a></h4>
<p>A UPS (uninterrupted power supply) is great for a 3node if your power goes on and off frequently for short periods of time. This ensures your 3node does not need to constantly reboot. If your electricity provider is very reliable, a UPS might not be needed, as the small downtime resulting from rare power outages with not exceed the DIY downtime limit*. (95% uptime, 5% downtime = 36 hours per month.) Of course, for greater Grid utilization experience, considering adding a UPS to your Threefold farm can be highly beneficial.</p>
<p>Note: Make sure to have AC Recovery Power set properly so your 3node goes back online if power shutdowns momentarily. UPS are generally used in data center to make sure people have enough time to do a &quot;graceful&quot; shutdown of the units when power goes off. In the case of 3nodes, they do not need graceful shutdowns as Zero-OS cannot lose data while functioning. The only way to power down a 3node is simply to turn it off directly on the machine.</p>

<h3 id="using-onboard-storage-3node-servers"><a class="header" href="#using-onboard-storage-3node-servers">Using Onboard Storage (3node Servers)</a></h3>
<p>If your 3node is based on a server, you can either use PCIe slots and PCIe-NVME adapter to install SSD NVME disk, or you can use the onboard storage.</p>
<p>Usually, servers use RAID technology for onboard storage. RAID is a technology that has brought resilience and security to the IT industry. But it has some limitations that ThreeFold did not want to get stuck with. Threefold developed a different and more efficient way to <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/cloud/threefold__cloud_products?id=storage-quantum-safe-filesystem">store data reliably</a>. This Quantum Safe Storage overcomes some of the shortfalls of RAID and is able to work over multiple nodes geographically spread on the TF Grid. This means that there is no RAID controller in between data storage and the TF Grid.</p>
<p>For your 3nodes, you want to bypass RAID in order for Zero-OS to have bare metals on the system. </p>
<p>To use onboard storage on a server without RAID, you can</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html">Re-flash</a> the RAID card</li>
<li>Turn on HBA/non-RAID mode</li>
<li>Install a different card.</li>
</ol>
<p>For HP servers, you simply turn on the HBA mode (Host Bus Adapter). </p>
<p>For Dell servers, you can either cross, or <a href="https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html">re-flash</a>, the RAID controller with an “IT-mode-Firmware” (see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5nb09VksYw">video</a>) or get a DELL H310-controller (which has the non-RAID option). Otherwise, you can install a NVME SSD with a PCIe adaptor, and turn off the RAID controller.</p>
<hr />
<p>Once the disks are wiped, you can shutdown your 3node and remove the Linux Bootstrap Image (USB key). Usually, there will be a message telling you when to do so.</p>

<hr />
<ol>
<li>Create a Linux Bootstrap Image</li>
<li>Boot Linux in <em>Try Mode</em></li>
<li>Wipe All the Disks</li>
</ol>
<p>Threefold runs its own OS, which is Zero-OS. You thus need to start with completely wiped disks. Note that ALL disks must be wiped. Otherwise, Zero-OS won't boot.</p>
<p>An easy method is to simply download a Linux distribution and wipe the disk with the proper command line in the Terminal.</p>
<p>We will show how to do this with Ubuntu 20.04. LTS. This distribution is easy to use and it is thus a good introduction for Linux, in case you haven't yet explored this great operating system.</p>
<h3 id="1-create-a-linux-bootstrap-image"><a class="header" href="#1-create-a-linux-bootstrap-image">1. Create a Linux Bootstrap Image</a></h3>
<p>Download the Ubuntu 20.04 ISO file <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">here</a> and burn the ISO image on a USB key. Make sure you have enough space on your USB key. You can also use other Linux Distro such as <a href="https://grml.org/download/">GRML</a>, if you want a ligther ISO image.</p>
<p>The process here is the same as in section <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#burning-the-zero-os-bootstrap-image">Burning the Bootstrap Image</a>, but with the Linux ISO instead of the Zero-OS ISO. <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">BalenaEtcher</a> is recommended as it formats your USB in the process, and it is available for MAC, Windows and Linux.</p>
<h3 id="2-boot-linux-in-try-mode"><a class="header" href="#2-boot-linux-in-try-mode">2. Boot Linux in <em>Try Mode</em></a></h3>
<p>When you boot the Linux ISO image, make sure to choose <em>Try Mode</em>. Otherwise, it will install Linux on your computer. You do not want this.</p>
<h3 id="3-use-wipefs-to-wipe-all-disks"><a class="header" href="#3-use-wipefs-to-wipe-all-disks">3. Use wipefs to wipe all disks</a></h3>
<p>When you use wipefs, you are removing all the data on your disk. Make sure you have no important data on your disks, or make sure you have copies of your disks before doing this operation, if needed. </p>
<p>Once Linux is booted, go into the terminal and write the following command lines.</p>
<p>First, you can check the available disks by writing in a terminal or in a shell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lsblk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see what disks are connected, write this command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fdisk -l</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to wipe one specific disk, here we use <em>sda</em> as an example, write this command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo wipefs -a /dev/sda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And replace the &quot;a&quot; in sda by the letter of your disk, as shown when you did <em>lsblk</em>. The term <em>sudo</em> gives you the correct permission to do this.</p>
<p>To wipe all the disks in your 3node, write the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo for i in /dev/sd*; do wipefs -a $i; done</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have any <code>fdisk</code> entries that look like <code>/dev/nvme</code>, you'll need to adjust the command line.</p>
<p>For a nvme disk, here we use <em>nvme0</em> as an example, write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo wipefs -a /dev/nvme0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And replace the &quot;0&quot; in nvme0 by the number corresponding to your disk, as shown when you did <em>lsblk</em>. </p>
<p>To wipe all the nvme disks, write this command line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for i in /dev/nvme*; do wipefs -a $i; done</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Note 1: If you're having trouble getting your disks recognized by Zero-OS, some farmers have had success enabling AHCI mode for SATA in their BIOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note 2: If you are using a server with onboard storage, you might need to <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide//faq/faq.html#is-there-a-way-to-bypass-raid-in-order-for-zero-os-to-have-bare-metals-on-the-system-no-raid-controller-in-between-storage-and-the-grid">re-flash the RAID card</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>For this section, note that the BIOS mode is usually needed for older hardware while the UEFI mode is usually needed for newer hardware, when it comes to booting properly Zero-OS on your DIY 3node.</p>
<p>If it doubt, start with UEFI and if it doesn't work as expected, try with BIOS.</p>

<hr />
<p>There are certain things that you should make sure are set properly on your 3node.</p>
<p>As a general advice, you can Load Defaults (Settings) on your BIOS, then make sure the options below are set properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the correct combination of BIOS/UEFI and bootstrap image on <a href="https://bootstrap.grid.tf/">https://bootstrap.grid.tf/</a>
<ul>
<li>Newer system will use UEFI</li>
<li>Older system will use BIOS
<ul>
<li>Hint:  If your 3node boot stops at <em>Initializing Network Devices</em>, try the other method (BIOS or UEFI)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set Multi-Processor and Hyperthreading at Enabled
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, it will be written Virtual Cores, or Logical Cores. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set Virtualization at Enabled
<ul>
<li>On Intel, it is denoted as CPU virtualization and on ASUS, it is denoted as SVM. </li>
<li>Make sure virtualization is enabled and look for the precise terms in your specific BIOS/UEFI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set AC Recovery at Last Power State
<ul>
<li>This will make sure your 3node restarts after losing power momentarily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select the proper Boot Sequence for the 3node to boot Zero-OS from your bootstrap image
<ul>
<li>e.g., if you have a USB key as a bootstrap image, select it in Boot Sequence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set Server Lookup Method (or the equivalent) at DNS. Only use Static IP if you know what you are doing.
<ul>
<li>Your router will assign a dynamic IP address to your 3node when it connects to Internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set Client Address Method (or the equivalent) at DHCP. Only use Static IP if you know what you are doing.
<ul>
<li>Your router will assign a dynamic IP address to your 3node when it connects to Internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Secure Boot should be left at disabled
<ul>
<li>Enable it if you know what you are doing. Otherwise, it can be set at disabled.</li>

<hr />
<p>Note from the list above that by enabling the DHCP and DNS in BIOS, dynamic IP addresses will be assigned to 3nodes. This way, you do not need any specific port configuration when booting a 3node.</p>
<p>As long as the 3node is connected to the Internet via an ethernet cable (WiFi is not supported), Zero-OS will be able to boot. By setting DHCP in BIOS, an IP address is automatically assigned to your 3node every time you boot it. This section concerns 3node servers with remote management functions and interfaces.</p>
<p>You can set up a node through static routing at the router without DHCP by assigning the MAC address of the NIC to a IP address within your private subnet. This will give a static IP address to your 3node.</p>
<p>With a static IP address, you can then configure remote management on servers. For Dell, <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000134243/how-to-setup-and-manage-your-idrac-or-cmc-for-dell-poweredge-servers-and-blades">iDRAC</a> is used, and for HP, <a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=a00045463en_us&amp;docLocale=en_US">ILO</a> is used.</p>

<h3 id="biosuefi-and-zero-os-bootstrap-image-combinations"><a class="header" href="#biosuefi-and-zero-os-bootstrap-image-combinations">BIOS/UEFI and Zero-OS Bootstrap Image Combinations</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>To boot your 3node, you need to create your own boot device for your system. This might sound like a big project to accomplish, but it's actually pretty simple. As simple as can be, you need a removable media (USB key for example) where you will burn/install the Zero-OS bootstrap image on it. The type of file you burn on the removable media will change depending if your system is old or recent. Older system uses BIOS and newer system uses UEFI.</p>
<p>Whether you use BIOS or UEFI, 3nodes are also self-healing, so once you set up your 3node, maintenance is minimal. </p>
<p>To properly boot the Zero-OS image, you can either use an image made for a BIOS system or a UEFI system, this depends on your system. </p>
<p>BIOS is older technology. It means <em>Basic Input/Output System</em>. </p>
<p>UEFI is newer technology. It means <em>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</em>. BIOS/UEFI is, in a way, the link between the hardware and the software of your computer.</p>
<p>In general, setting a 3node is similar whether it is with a BIOS or UEFI system. The important is to choose the correct combination of boot media + boot mode (BIOS/UEFI).</p>
<p>The bootstrap images are available <a href="https://bootstrap.grid.tf/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The choices are:</p>
<ol>
<li>EFI IMG - UEFI</li>
<li>EFI FILE - UEFI</li>
<li>iPXE - Boot from network</li>
<li>ISO - BIOS</li>
<li>USB - BIOS</li>
<li>LKRN - Boot from network</li>
</ol>
<p>Choices 1 and 2 are for UEFI (newer models).
Choices 4 and 5 are for BIOS (newer models).
Choices 3 and 6 are mainly for network boot.</p>
<p>For information on how to boot Zero-OS with iPXE, read <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#advanced-booting-option---network-booting-pxe">this section</a>.</p>
<p>You might have to try UEFI first and if it doesn't work, try BIOS. Usually when this is the case (UEFI doesn't work with your current computer), the following message will be shown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initializing Network Devices...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then... nothing. This means that you are still in the BIOS of the hardware and boot is not even started yet. When this happens, try the BIOS mode of your computer. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Additional information :</strong> One of the great features of Zero-OS is that it can be completely run within the cache of your 3node. Indeed, the booting device, that contains your farm ID, will connect to the Threefold Grid and download everything needed to run smoothly. There are many benefits in terms of security and protection of data that comes with this.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let's go into BIOS mode now!</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example-of-bios-settings---rack-server---dell-r720"><a class="header" href="#example-of-bios-settings---rack-server---dell-r720">Example of BIOS Settings - Rack Server - Dell R720</a></h4>
<hr />
<p>The following covers proper settings for the BIOS mode of a DIY 3node. Note that it is also called the normal BIOS or legacy BIOS.</p>
<p>There might be other ways to configure those settings, depending on the specific computer. Depending on your hardware (disks connections, RAID controller, etc.), you might need to change some settings to fit the specific model. Most of the time, if you follow these lines, your 3node should work 100% with the Grid. Check the <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide//faq/faq.html#troubleshooting-and-error-messages">Troubleshooting and Error Messages</a> section if you have trouble on your way to booting Zero-OS.</p>
<p>It is possible that your 3node needs to be booted with the UEFI mode. In this case, refer to the <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#example-of-uefi-settings---desktop-computer---dell-optiplex-7010">next section</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Note that the settings are similar for UEFI and non-UEFI. But some details are important.</p>
<p>To boot Zero-OS, you need to use the bootstrap image <a href="https://bootstrap.grid.tf/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Old servers/desktops will need to use the 4th and 5th options (named: ISO and USB). Newer servers/desktops can use UEFI (1st and 2nd option).</p>
<p>The BIOS setting in BIOS (non-UEFI) mode presented here is mostly based on a Dell R720. We also add information to cover more broadly the subject. There may be differences with your specific 3node hardware. The following should give you a good overview of how to set it up and you can adjust the details. For newer servers, UEFI mode might be the preferred option.</p>
<hr />
<p>Please note that you can set your iDRAC with remote access. In this section, we set up the 3node directly with a monitor and keyboard. Once this BIOS settings are set and the 3node is running, you will not need to do much maintenance on the server's BIOS or iDRAC settings, thanks to the Self-Healing properly of Threefold's Zero-OS.</p>
<hr />
<p>SYSTEM SETUP</p>
<hr />
<p>To enter into system setup, you need to press a certain key when the computer is powered on. With Dell server R720, hit F2 to get into System Setup.</p>
<p>To set the 3node running, you will need to configure the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>System BIOS</li>
<li>iDRAC Settings</li>
</ul>
<p>First, let's go into System BIOS.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>System BIOS</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>MEMORY SETTINGS</p>
<hr />
<p>In <code>System BIOS</code>, go into <code>Memory Settings</code> and make sure the Memory parameters are correct (Size, Type, Speed, Voltage). If you have less GB of RAM than expected, perhaps the RAM sticks are not well seated. </p>
<p>You will have the choice of enabling or disabling the function <code>System Memory Testing</code>. You can leave this at <code>disabled</code> in general. You will want it at <code>enabled</code> when you want to tests the condition and integrity of the 3node's memory.</p>
<p>The options for <code>Memory Operating Mode</code> are the following, with <strong>Optimizer Mode</strong> being the option by default, which you can leave as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimizer Mode</li>
<li>Advanced ECC Mode</li>
<li>Mirror Mode</li>
<li>Spare Mode</li>
<li>Dell Fault Resilient Mode</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have the choice of enabling or disabling the function <code>Node Interleaving</code>.</p>
<p>Usually your system will run faster with this option <code>disabled</code>.</p>
<p>When <code>enabled</code>, Node Interleaving will interleave the memory addresses across the memory in each processor. In some situation and for certain workload, this can improve the performance.</p>
<hr />
<p>PROCESSOR SETTINGS </p>
<hr />
<p>Next, we will adjust the proper settings for the processors in <code>Processor Settings</code>. </p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Settings</th><th>Option</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Logical Processors</td><td><strong>Enabled</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>QPI Speed</td><td>Maximum datarate</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Alternate RTID</td><td>Disabled</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Virtualization Technology</td><td>Enabled</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Adjacent Cache Line Prefetch</td><td>Enabled</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Hardware Prefetcher</td><td>Enabled</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>DCU Streamer Prefetcher</td><td>Enabled</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>DCU IP Prefetcher</td><td>Enabled</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Execute Disable</td><td>Enabled</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Logical Processor Idling</td><td>Disabled</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Dell Controlled Turbo</td><td>Disabled</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Number of Cores per Processor</td><td><strong>All</strong></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Setting Logical Processor at Enabled is particularly important. If you're supposed to have <code>x</code> vcores, and the Explorer says you only have <code>x/2</code> (only half of expected vcores), chances are you need to enable this setting. Also make sure the number of cores is set to <strong>All</strong>.</p>
<p>Next in the section Processor Settings, you will see the information of your processor(s). The number of cores per processor will also be shown. In short, make sure you have the expected processors and number of cores.</p>
<hr />
<p>SATA SETTINGS</p>
<hr />
<p>Next, we will adjust the proper software settings for the SATA connections and hardware in <code>SATA Settings</code>.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Settings</th><th>Option</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Embedded SATA</td><td><strong>AHCI</strong>/RAID/ATA/Off</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Port A (First port)</td><td>Auto</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Port Z (Last port)</td><td>Auto</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>If you are using SATA disks, you probably want #1 set to AHCI. Depending on your disks configurations, you might need to chance this parameter.</p>
<p>The rest of the settings are for the Ports. You can always check in the User's Guide of your server to check which ports are for which hardware. For example, on Dell R720, Port E is for the optical drive (CD/DVD).</p>
<hr />
<p>BOOT SETTINGS</p>
<hr />
<p>Next, we will adjust the proper settings for the processors <code>BOOT Settings</code>.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Settings</th><th>Option</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td>BOOT Mode</td><td><strong>BIOS</strong> / UEFI</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Boot Sequence Retry</td><td><strong>Enabled</strong> / Disabled</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>BIOS Boot Settings</td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>BIOS Boot Settings</td><td>...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Since we are doing a BIOS boot, and not a UEFI boot, for the 3node, make sure you have BIOS mode instead of UEFI selected. Otherwise it won't boot properly. For newer servers, work with UEFI instead.</p>
<p>You can have Boot Sequence Retry Enabled, but your server should boot fine without. When enabled, the system will reattempt the boot sequence 30 seconds after a failed booting sequence.</p>
<p>Then you need to save these changes and come back to access BIOS Boot Settings (if you were previously set to UEFI mode).</p>
<hr />
<p>BIOS Boot Settings</p>
<hr />
<p>Next, we will adjust the proper settings for the processors <code>BIOS Boot Settings</code>. Note that USB keys will often be called <strong>Hard drive C:</strong>. Click on <strong>Boot Sequence</strong> and choose the proper order for your 3node configuration. Here we choose <strong>Hard drive C:</strong> as we will be booting from USB key. If you use another method than a USB key, make sure you select it. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BOOT Sequence</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hard drive C:</strong></li>
<li>SATA Port</li>
<li>Integrated NIC</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

Hard drive C:</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"/>
SATA Port:</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"/>
...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Boot Option Enable/Disable, you can check the option you will be using for your booting device. Here we check <code>Hard drive C:</code>, as we are booting Zero-OS from a USB key.</p>
<hr />
<p>INTEGRATED DEVICES</p>
<hr />
<p>Next, we will adjust the proper settings for the <code>Integrated Devices</code>.
This will change depending on your hardware configuration.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Settings</th><th>Option</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<p>The RAID controller can be disabled if you are plugging your disks with a PCIe adaptors or the SATA connection of the optical drive. If you are using the front panel disks, you will need to deal with RAID configuration. You can also use RAID 0. But in general, 3nodes do not use RAID. </p>
<p>You can use the onboard storage on a server without RAID. You can <a href="https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html">re-flash</a> the RAID card, turn on HBA/non-RAID mode, or install a different card. There is no need for RAID on a 3node.</p>
<p>It's usually easy to set servers such as a HP Proliant with the HBA mode. For Dell servers, you can either cross-flash the RAID controller with an “IT-mode-Firmware” (see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5nb09VksYw">video</a>) or get a DELL H310-controller (which has the non-RAID option). Otherwise, you can install a NVME SSD with a PCIe adaptor as stated above.</p>
<p>Concerning RAID technology, here is what Weynand Kuijpers, one of Threefold's co-founders, has to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RAID is a technology that has brought resilience and security to the IT industry. But it has some limitations that we at ThreeFold did not want to get stuck in. We developed a different (and more efficient way to store data reliably. Please have a look <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/cloud/threefold__cloud_products?id=storage-quantum-safe-filesystem">here</a>. </p>
<p>This Quantum Safe Storage overcomes some of the shortfalls of RAID and is able to work over multiple nodes geographically spread on the TF Grid.</p>

<p>Usually you can leave all USB ports accessible. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can choose to leave your booting device inside the server (this is recommended). You might sometimes have to upgrade the booting device, but minor upgrades are always done via the Threefold Grid so this would not happen often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to enable your Network Card so your 3node can connect to the Threefold Grid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OS Timer is not necessary as Zero-OS is self-healing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default, this parameter is enabled. The video controller is used to check the 3node Zero-OS status. Note that it is possible to run a 3node headless, and/or without a GPU connected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is for virtualization devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory Mapped is to perit PCIe devices to uses a lot of memory. Useful for NVME SSD PCIe adaptor 3node build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enable PCIe slots. You can leave them all enabled, and disabled them for specific use cases.</p>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>All slots should be set at Enabled in Slot Disablement. You might want to disable unused slots depending on your spectific configuration.</p>
<hr />
<p>SERIAL COMMUNICATION</p>
<hr />
<p>Next, we will adjust the proper settings for the <code>Serial Communication</code>.
This can change depending on your hardware configuration.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Settings</th><th>Option</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Serial Communication</td><td><strong>On without Console Redirection</strong></td></tr>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>In general, this section can be left with the default parameters. It can be useful when you have specific connections and want to use remote access device.</p>
<ol>
<li>To select serial communication devices.</li>
<li>This can be used to set the port address for serial devices.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>SYSTEM PROFILE</p>
<hr />
<p>Next, we will adjust the proper settings for the <code>System Profile</code>.
This can change depending on your hardware configuration.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Settings</th><th>Option</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td>System Profile</td><td><strong>Performance Per Watt (DAPC)</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>CPU Power Management</td><td><strong>System DBPM (DAPC)</strong></td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>Memory Refresh Rate</td><td><strong>1x</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Memory Operating Voltage</td><td><strong>Auto</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Collaborative CPU Performance Control</td><td><strong>Disabled</strong></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>System Profile Settings can be at Performance Per Watt. In this case, all the parameters are locked to default. This is aimed at being efficient and consume less power.</p>
<p>You can also use custom parameters. Make sure you know what you are doing. Many things can be done such as changing the frequency and the DIMM voltage selection. This can, in certain situations, increase the 3node's performance.</p>
<hr />
<p>SYSTEM SECURITY</p>
<hr />
<p>Next, we will adjust the proper settings for the <code>System Security</code>. Here you can set a password for the BIOS and also set the AC Power Recovery with a set detay.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Settings</th><th>Option</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Password Status</td><td><strong>Unlocked</strong> / Locked</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>AC Power Recovery Delay</td><td><strong>User Defined</strong>*</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>*In System Security, it can be very useful to set AC Power Recovery at <strong>Last</strong>. If your 3node is powered on and you have an electric outage, your 3node will power back on when the power outage is over. You can also set it to <strong>power on</strong> after X seconds (from 0 to 240 with Dell servers). Imagine if you have 15 power outage in the same 30 minutes, your serves would constantly power back on, and this could damage the unit if this is done too frequently. For this reason, it is good to set the power on after 30 seconds or more.</p>
<p>To reset your Trusted Platform Module (TPM), use TPM Clear.</p>
<hr />
<p>MISCELLANEOUS SETTINGS</p>
<hr />
<p>Next, we will adjust the proper settings for the <code>Miscellaneous Settings</code>.
This can change depending on your hardware configuration.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Settings</th><th>Option</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td>System Time</td><td>HH:MM:SS PM</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>System Date</td><td>DD/MM/YYYY</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The settings in this section can be left at default. It is good to verify that the date and time are correct. Some farmers have reported that their 3nodes were not booting easily when they were out of sync.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>iDRAC Settings</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The next section covers the basic to set a iDRAC that will run properly with the 3node and help ease the farming maintenance. It is possible to set the iDRAC completely with a remote access. This will be partly covered here, but it is not the focus. Once your 3node is booted and connected to the TF Grid, minimal maintenances are required.</p>
<hr />
<p>SYSTEM SUMMARY</p>
<hr />
<p>In System Summary, you can see your computer informations. It's a good thing to make sure you have the latest iDRAC Firmware. Here you can make sure IPv4 and DHCP are Enabled.</p>
<p>To set the iDRAC remotely, you can look at the iDRAC MAC Address.</p>
<hr />
<p>SYSTEM EVENT LOG</p>
<hr />
<p>In System Event Log, you can Clear Records. This can be a good thing to do when you buy a used server. 
In Display System Event Log, you can check the history of your 3node. This can be good for specific troubleshootings.</p>
<hr />
<p>NETWORK</p>
<hr />
<p>In Network, make sure to set Enabled at Enable NIC and Auto Dedicated NIC. You will also need to enable DHCP and IPV4 (and IPV6 if needed). For remote access, you will need to Enabled Register DRAC on DNS and Use DHCP to obtain DNS server addresses.</p>
<hr />
<p>FRONT PANEL SECURITY</p>
<hr />
<p>In Front Panel Security, you want to make sure Disable Power Button is set at No. Front Panel Access can be set to Full Capabilities as this can be useful to check your server's parameters. </p>
<hr />
<p>VIRTUAL MEDIA</p>
<hr />
<p>Virtual Media setting can be set at Auto attach. This is for remote usage of software image files (ISO-files). This is used to update servers and install operating systems.</p>
<hr />
<p>vFlash Media</p>
<hr />
<p>Enable vFlash can be set at Disabled in the vFlash Media section. This SD card can be used as a storage device to boot Zero-OS. It can also be used as a storage backup when replacing the motherboard.</p>
<hr />
<p>LIFECYCLE CONTROLLER</p>
<hr />
<p>It's good to set Enabled at Lifecycle Controller and Collect System Inventory on Restart. This checks if anything new was added to the server between usages. Also Lifecycle Controller can be used to set iDRAC remotely.</p>
<hr />
<p>POWER CONFIGURATION</p>
<hr />
<p>You can disable Power Cap Policy and set Power Supply Options - Redundant Policy at Not Redundant. If you want to put a power limit on the system, you can set Power Cap Policy at enabled.</p>
<p>You can enable Power Factor Correction to improve the server's efficiency and reduce current, but this is not necessary.</p>
<p>Make sure <strong>Hot Spare is Enabled</strong>. This feature makes sure the server will function properly if one of the two PSU (power supply unit) is damaged or removed during use.</p>
<hr />
<p>SMART CARD</p>
<hr />
<p>The Smart Card option can be Disabled. This can be used to connect to iDRAC with a Two Factor Authetication (2FA).</p>
<hr />
<p>THERMAL</p>
<hr />
<p>In the section Thermal, you can set Thermal Base Algorithm at Auto and the Cooling Options at Default.</p>
<hr />
<p>COMMUNICATION PERMISSIONS</p>
<hr />
<p>Communication Permissions can be disabled. When enabled, you can launch the browswer in the host OS, but this does not really apply to a 3node.</p>
<hr />
<p>USER CONFIGURATION</p>
<hr />
<p>In User Configuration, you want to enable Enable User. You can set a password.</p>
<hr />
<p>REMOTE ENABLEMENT</p>
<hr />
<p>To use iDRAC remotely with Dell OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA), you will need to set Enable Auto-Discovery at Enabled. Otherwise, you can set it at Disabled.</p>
<hr />
<p>SYSTEM LOCATION</p>
<hr />
<p>System Location can be useful if you are in a data center. You don't need to fill in any information.</p>
<hr />
<p>RESET iDRAC</p>
<hr />
<p>If ever needed, you can do a Factory Reset of the iDRAC configuration.</p>
<hr />
<p>We have been through the BIOS settings and th iDRAC settings of a typical Dell R720 Server. With these notions in mind, you should be able to properly set your DIY 3node. Some changes may be needed depending on your hardware and desired configuration. </p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example-of-uefi-settings---desktop-computer---dell-optiplex-7010"><a class="header" href="#example-of-uefi-settings---desktop-computer---dell-optiplex-7010">Example of UEFI Settings - Desktop Computer - Dell Optiplex 7010</a></h4>
<hr />
<p>The UEFI mode is usually needed for newer hardware.</p>
<hr />
<p>There might be other ways to configure those settings, depending on the specific computer. Depending on your hardware (disks connections, RAID controller, etc.), you might need to change some settings to fit your specific computer model. Most of the time, if you follow these lines, your 3node should work 100% with the Threefold Grid. Check the <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide//faq/faq.html#troubleshooting-and-error-messages">Troubleshooting and Error Messages</a> section if you have trouble on your way to booting Zero-OS.</p>
<p>It is possible that your 3node needs to be booted with the BIOS mode. In this case, refer to the <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#example-of-bios-settings---rack-server---dell-r720">previous section</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>To boot Zero-OS, you need to use the bootstrap image <a href="https://bootstrap.grid.tf/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Old servers/desktops will need to use the non-UEFI mode, which are the 4th and 5th options (named: ISO and USB). Newer servers/desktops can use UEFI (1st and 2nd option.</p>
<p>We will now present the BIOS/UEFI settings that work with Threefold Zero-OS.
Note that the settings are similar for UEFI and non-UEFI. But some details are important.</p>
<p>The UEFI settings are from a HP G1 EliteDesk Desktop. These should give you a good overview of how to set it up.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>UEFI mode with HP EliteDesk.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The following section will propose UEFI settings to boot a 3node properly on the TF Grid. Note that the settings might need some modifications in your specific situations. These guidelines will help you set your 3node properly.</p>
<p>Start your computer and hit Escape to get into the startup Menu. For some other computers, it can be another key. It's usually shown at the start of the boot.
Hit F10 or click on Computer Setup.</p>
<hr />
<p>It can be a good idea to first check in System Information that your setup is as expected.</p>
<p>Here you can see your computer model and manufacturer. You can check that the processors are properly recognized and that you have the correct quantity of RAM. It's a good idea to check the BIOS and Firmware Versions. Updating the UEFI can help to boot the 3node.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Storage -&gt; Device Configuration, you can see if all your disks are well connected (SATA, USB, etc.). Usually, to be recognized, you need to plug your removable media before booting the 3node.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Storage -&gt; Storage Options, select AHCI as SATA Emulation and make sure Removable Media Boot is Enabled. For some specific configurations, you will want to use another paramter than AHCI.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Storage -&gt; Boot Order, you can choose the UEFI Boot Sources. If you are using a removable media, make sure it is the first in the list. Options can be: USB Hard Drive, USB Floppy/CD, CD/DVD Drive and more.</p>
<p>If you are booting from a USB key, you'll want to select USB Hard Drive first for the Boot Order.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the section Security -&gt; Device Security, you can see that your devices are available. </p>
<ul>
<li>Netowrk Controller</li>
<li>SATA0</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>SATA2</li>
<li>...
In the section Device Security, make sure all are set to Device Available.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>In Security -&gt; USB Security, make sure the port you want to use is Enabled. The easy way is to make them all Enabled.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Security -&gt; Slot Security, you can enable the PCI Express (PCIe) slots. This can be useful when you have SSD NVME disk to use via a PCIe adapter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Network boot can be set at Disabled if you are booting with a removable media (USB key, CD/DVD). If you are using PXE mode, you will need to set the Network Boot at Enabled.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Security -&gt; Master Boot Record Security, you can se it at Disabled. This is used to successfully boot from a disk while accessing the data it contains. In the case of Zero-OS, the OS is on the removable media.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Security -&gt; System Security, you can enable Data Execution Prevention and OS management of Embedded Security Device. This is the place to set the Virtualization Technology (VTx). It is needed with Zero-OS in order for users to deploy virtual machines on the 3nodes.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Security -&gt; Secure Boot Configuration, make sure you have Legacy Support set at Enabled (without this, your 3node can't boot without a monitor). You should also Disabled the Secure Boot. Sometimes Zero-OS won't boot otherwise. There is no security problem when doing so to a 3node running on Zero-OS. </p>
<p>Enabling Secure Boot can be helpful when setting a 3node and you want to be sure no one can access the BIOS/UEFI and change the settings.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Power -&gt; OS Power Management, it can be set to Enabled Extended and Disabled.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Power -&gt; Hardware Power Management, both SATA Power Management and PCI Express Power Mangement can be set at Enabled. It can be set to Enabled Extended and Disabled. Here are the settings for Hard Power Management. S5 Maximum Power Savings can be set at Disabled. This function, when the computer is off, will turn off the power of all nonessential hardware.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Advanted -&gt; Power-On Options, it is a good idea to have After Power Loss set at Previous State. You can select a proper POST Delay (in seconds). This means if your servers are running and you get a power outage, they will turn back on when power comes back. As 3nodes don't have &quot;graceful shutdown&quot;, if you lose electricity momentarily, the 3node will symply reboot and continue its work. No data can be lost when a 3node is shutdown.</p>
<p>If you have different 3nodes on the same breaker, it can be a good idea to set different POST delay timer. This will ensure that you do not have a sudden high power demand when they power on.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Advanced -&gt; BIOS Power-On, you can set all the BIOS Power-On Option at Disabled.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Advanced -&gt; Bus Options, you can set PCI SERR# Generation at Enabled, but it is simply concerning ill-behaved PCI add-in cards. PCI VGA Palette Snooping concerns graphics and can be set at Disabled.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Advanced -&gt; Device Options, you can Enabled Turbo Mode. It is very important to have <strong>Multi-Processor and Hyperthreading at Enabled.</strong> Sometimes, it will be written Virtual Cores, or Logical Cores. </p>
<hr />
<p>In Advanced -&gt; Management Operations, you can set the Active Management Technology (AMT). This is for remote access and is not necessary when it comes to booting and running a 3node.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Advanced -&gt; Option ROM Launch Policy, you can all all the parameters at Legacy Only. In Legacy mode, the computer will be able to boot from all bootage devices. </p>
<hr />
<p>In Advanced -&gt; Update BIOS via Network, you can set automatic BIOS Update and enabled Update via Network. You can either leave it Enabled or Disabled. To upgrade the BIOS, you can also use a booting removable device (USB key) containing the newer firmware file.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Advanced -&gt; Ethernet Connection -&gt; NIC Configuration, make sure your Link Status is at Connected.</p>
<hr />
<p>That's it. You went through the whole Computer Setup and this should get your 3node working good.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will boot the 3node and connect to the Threefold Grid. How exciting!</p>

<hr />
<p>To boot Zero-OS, insert your Zero-OS Bootstrap Image, power on your computer and choose the right booting sequence and parameters (<a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#bios-mode">BIOS</a> or <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#uefi-mode">UEFI</a>) in your BIOS/UEFI settings. Then, restart the 3node. Zero-OS should boot automatically.</p>
<p>Note that you need an ethernet cable connected to your router or switcher. You cannot farm on the Threefold Grid with Wifi.</p>
<p>The first time you boot a 3node, it will be written: “This node is not registered (farmer ***: NameOfFarm). This is normal. The Grid will create a node ID and you will be able to see it on screen. This can take a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>If time passes (an hour and more) and the node does not get registered, in many cases, <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#4-wipe-all-the-disks">wiping the disks</a> all over again and trying another reboot usually resolves this issue.</p>

<p>Network booting ditches your standard boot USB with a local server. This TFTP server delivers your boot files to your 3 nodes. This can be useful in bigger home farms, but is all but mandatory in a data center setup. </p>
<p>Network boot setup is quite easy and is centered about configuring a TFTP server. There are essentially 2 options for this, a small dedicated server such as a raspberry pi, or piggybacking on your pfsense or opnsense router. I would recommend the latter as it eliminates another piece of equipment and is probably more reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Setting Up Your Router to Allow Network Booting</strong></p>
<p>These steps are for OPNsense, PFsense may differ. These set are required regardless of where you have your TFTP server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Services&gt;DHCPv4&gt;LAN&gt;Network Booting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check “Enable Network Booting”</p>
<p>Enter the IP address of your TFTP server under “Set next-server IP”. This may be the router’s IP or whatever device you are booting from.</p>
<p>Enter “pxelinux.0” under Set default bios filename.</p>
<p>Ignore the TFTP Server settings.</p>
<p><strong>TFTP server setup on a debian machine such as Ubuntu or Raspberry Pi</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>apt-get update</p>
<p>apt-get install tftpd-hpa</p>
<p>cd /srv/tftp/</p>
<p>wget http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/buster/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz</p>
<p>wget http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/buster/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/pxelinux.0</p>
<p>wget https://bootstrap.grid.tf/krn/prod/<FARMID> --no-check-certificate</p>
<p>mv <FARMID> ipxe-prod.lkrn</p>
<p>tar -xvzf netboot.tar.gz</p>
<p>rm version.info netboot.tar.gz</p>
<p>rm pxelinux.cfg/default</p>
<p>chmod 777 /srv/tftp/pxelinux.cfg (optional if next step fails)</p>
<p>echo 'default ipxe-prod.lkrn' &gt;&gt; pxelinux.cfg/default</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TFTP Server on a OPNsense router</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: When using PFsense instead of OPNsense, steps are probably similar, but the directory or other small things may differ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first step is to download the TFTP server plugin. Go to system&gt;firmware&gt;Status and check for updates, follow prompts to install. Then click the Plugins tab and search for tftp, install os-tftp. Once that is installed go to Services&gt;TFTP (you may need to refresh page). Check the Enable box and input your router ip (normally 192.168.1.1). Click save.</p>
<p>Turn on ssh for your router. In OPNsense it is System&gt;Settings&gt;Administration. Then check the Enable, root login, and password login. Hop over to Putty and connect to your router, normally 192.168.1.1. Login as root and input your password. Hit 8 to enter the shell.</p>
<p>In OPNsense the tftp directory is /usr/local/tftp</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cd /usr/local</p>
<p>mkdir tftp</p>
<p>cd ./tftp</p>
<p>fetch http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/buster/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz</p>
<p>fetch http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/buster/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/pxelinux.0</p>
<p>fetch https://bootstrap.grid.tf/krn/prod/<FARMID> </p>
<p>mv <FARMID> ipxe-prod.lkrn</p>
<p>tar -xvzf netboot.tar.gz</p>
<p>rm version.info netboot.tar.gz</p>
<p>rm pxelinux.cfg/default</p>
<p>echo 'default ipxe-prod.lkrn' &gt;&gt; pxelinux.cfg/default</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can get out of shell by entering exit or just closing the window.</p>
<p><strong>3Node Setup</strong></p>
<p>Set the server to BIOS boot and put PXE or network boot as the first choice. At least on Dell machines, make sure you have the network cable in plug 1 or it won’t boot.</p>

<p>These are the steps required to enable PXE booting on pfSense. This guide assumes you’ll be using the router as your PXE server; pfSense allows boot file uploads directly from its web GUI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into your pfSense instance
<ul>
<li>Go to System&gt;Package Manager
<ul>
<li>Search and add ‘tftpd’ package under ‘Available Packages’ tab</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to Services&gt;TFTP Server
<ul>
<li>Under ‘Settings’ tab check enable and enter the router IP in TFTP Server Bind IP field</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Switch to ‘Files’ tab under Services&gt;TFTP Server and upload your ‘ipxe-prod.efi’ file acquired from https://v3.bootstrap.grid.tf/ (second option labeled ‘EFI Kernel’)</li>
<li>Go to Services&gt;DHCP Server
<ul>
<li>Under ‘Other Options’ section click Display Advance next to ‘TFTP’ and enter router IP</li>
<li>Click Display Advance next to ‘Network Booting’</li>
<li>Check enable, enter router IP in Next Server field</li>
<li>Enter ipxe-prod.efi in Default BIOS file name field</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it! You’ll want to ensure your clients are configured with boot priority set as IPv4 in first spot. You might need to disable secure boot and enable legacy boot within BIOS.</p>

<hr />
<p>It's important to have a good cable management, specially if you are in a data center. Proper cable management will improve the cooling streams of your farm. There shouldn't be any cable in front of the fans. This way, your servers will last longer. If you want to patch a rack, you have to have all lenght of patch cables from 30cm to 3m. Also, try to keep the cables as short as possible. Arrange the cables in bundles of eight and lead them to the sides of the rack as much as possible for optimal airflow.</p>

<h1 id="farming-optimization-and-planification"><a class="header" href="#farming-optimization-and-planification">Farming Optimization and Planification</a></h1>
<p>The last section covered the notions necessary to build a DIY 3node server. The following section will give you additional information with the goal of optimizing your farm while also being able to plan ahead the costs in terms of energy and capitals. We note that the Threefold token entry priced is locked for 5 years when you connect a 3node to the Threefold Grid v3. This means that you will farm a constant number of TFT per month, and this, for a duration of 60 months. </p>
<p>This fact is very important as it gives you the basis for economic planning. Setting the price of the TFT you will sell at the same price of your 3node entry price is a conservative approach. Why? Because, as TFT becomes scarce, and the Grid's utility and diversity expand, it is logical to plan that the price of TFT will increase. In short, if you can have a decent return on investment (ROI) with your 3node(s) and your Threefold farm, based on your TFT entry price, you can have a greater confidence that you will be fruitful in this New Internet Adventure. Of course, this is not financial advice.</p>
<p>As an economic comparative tool, many farmers will check the TFT per month for each dollar invested. This constitutes a good way to see if a 3node build is economically sound. It's then easy to compare between two different 3nodes configurations.</p>
<p>Note that the goal is to bring the best service and resources possible on the Grid, while maximizing profits. Why? Because the sooner you pay back your initial investment, the sooner you can build even more 3nodes and decentralized even more Internet! You are warned, You Farmer of the New Internet, that once you start to walk on the Threefold journey, it becomes harder and harder to resist the temptation of building another 3node, and then another, and another...</p>
<p>On a more serious note, remember that the CPU of your 3node should have 1000 passmark per core. This ensures a minimum of quality for the whole TF Grid. Also, it is important to have a sufficient bandwidth in terms of Internet Service Provider (ISP). Why? Because you will need to have sufficient badnwidth when your 3nodes will be used by Threefold users on the Grid. </p>
<p>The CPU passmark threshold is not yet implemented, but it constitutes a good way to make sure the hardware you bring to the Threefold Grid will contribute healthily to the New Internet.</p>

<h2 id="calculate-the-roi-of-a-diy-3node"><a class="header" href="#calculate-the-roi-of-a-diy-3node">Calculate the ROI of a DIY 3node</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>To calculate the ROI of a DIY 3node, we first calculate the Revenue per Month:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revenue per month = TFT price when sold * TFT farmed per month</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ROI of a DIY 3node is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cost of 3node / Revenue per month = ROI in months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, a Rack Server farming 3000 TFT per month with an initial cost of 1500$USD has the following ROI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1500 / (3000 * 0.08) = 6.25 month ROI</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, we remember, is with a conservative TFT price. Yummy. (Not Financial Advice!)</p>
<p>Is it possible to build such DIY 3node? Yes it is! Check this section <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#the-rack-server-diy-3node">The Rack Server DIY 3node</a> and try not to build more 3nodes.</p>
<p>Note that this ROI equation is used to compare efficienty between different DIY 3nodes. It does not constitute real final gains as additional costs must be taken into consideration, such as electricity for the 3nodes, for the AC system, as well as Internet bandwidth. This will be covered later.</p>

<h3 id="calculate-the-minimum-btu-needed-for-the-ac"><a class="header" href="#calculate-the-minimum-btu-needed-for-the-ac">Calculate the Minimum BTU Needed for the AC</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>Let's see how to calculate how powerful your AC unit needs to be when it comes to cooling down your server room.</p>
<p>As we know, servers generate heat when they are working. While a desktop 3node will generate under 20W at idle and a server 3node might use 100W at idle, when you pile up some 3nodes desktops/servers in the same location, things can get pretty warm when cultivation on the Grid is happening. Indeed, when your servers will be using a lot of power, especially in the summer time, you might need some additional cooling.</p>
<p>A good thing about servers generating heat is that this can be used as a <strong>heat source in the winter</strong>. Other more advanced techniques can be used to maximize the heat production. But that's for another day! </p>
<p>Note that for small farms, your current heating and cooling system may suffice.</p>
<p>So let's do the calculation:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>How Much BTU does your Threefold Farm Need to Cool Your Servers?</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>It's pretty simple actually. You need to keep in mind that <strong>1 kW of power is equivalent to 3413 BTU</strong> (Britisth Thermal Unit). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 kW = 3413 BTU</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So with our idle server example running at 100W, we have 0.1 kW. This is 341.3 BTU.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>100 W / 1000 = 0.1 kW</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have that 100 Watt is 0.1 kiloWatt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.1 kWh * 3413 = 341.3 BTU</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we multiply our kW by BTU factor <strong>3413</strong>.
Say you have 5 servers with this same configuration. It means you have </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(# of servers) * (BTU per server) = Total BTU</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 * 341.3 =  1706.5 BTU</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, a 2000 BTU Air Conditioner would be able to compensate for the heat when your servers are at idle.</p>
<hr />
<p>Please take note that this does not take into account the energy needed to cool down your environment. You'd need to take into consideration <strong>the heat of the servers and the general heat of your environment</strong> to figure out how much BTU your AC needs in the big heat days of the summer.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Let there Be Cultivation</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But then, what happens at cultivation? Well, say your server needs 400W of power when it's being fully cultivated by some lively Threefold Users of the New Internet. In this case, we would say that 400 W is the power consumption at <strong>full load</strong>.</p>
<p>As we started with 100 W, and we now have 400 W, it means that you'd need four times the amount of BTU. </p>
<p>Here we show how to calculate this with any other configuration of full load/idle. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cultivation-Idle Ratio =  Cultivation W / Idle W</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4 = 400 W / 100 W</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BTU needed in cultivation would be </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Full-Load / Idle Ratio) * Idle BTU = Full Load BTU</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>4 * (1706.5 BTU at Idle) = 6826 BTU at Full Load</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, you would need 6826 BTU from the AC unit for 5 servers running each at 400W. In that case, a 8000 BTU AC unit would be sufficient. Let's say your environment would typically need 4000 BTU to cool the room, you'd need about 12000 BTU AC unit for the whole setup. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If: BTU needed &lt; BTU AC Unit, Then: AC Unit is OK for TF farming at full load.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Now you can have a better idea of how much BTU is necessary for your AC unit. Of course, this can be a useful piece of data to incorporate in your simulation of Revenue/Cost farming.</p>
<p>The <strong>general equation</strong> would then be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Server Power in kW at Full Load * 3413 * Number of Servers = Total Maximum BTU needed per Threefold Farm</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>As another example, 7 servers using 120 W of power at idle would need:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.12 * 3413 * 7 = 2866.92 BTU</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During cultivation, these 7 servers might use 480 W. This would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.48 * 3413 * 7 = 11467.68 BTU</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be sure everything's OK, this set up would need a 12 000 BTU AC unit to compensate for the heat generated by the Threefold Farm during full cultivation. This example considers the environment heat to be negligible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11467.68 &lt; 12000 --&gt; 12K BTU AC Unit is OK for farm</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>That's it! It ain't any more complicated. Straight up mathematics and some judgment.</p>
<p>Now, let's calcute the costs of running all this!</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="ensure-proper-relative-humidity"><a class="header" href="#ensure-proper-relative-humidity">Ensure Proper Relative Humidity</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>To ensure that the relative humidity in your server room stays within a proper range, look in your server's user manual to know the proper range of relative humidity your server can handle. If necessary, use an hygrometer to measure relative humidity and make sure it stays within an acceptable range for your 3nodes.</p>
<p>Depending on your geographical location and your current situation, it could be interesting to consider having a AC unit equipped with a dehumidifier. Read your servers' manual to check the proper relative humidity range and set the unit accordingly. The maximum/minimum temperature and relative humidity a 3node server can handle will depend on the specific server/computer you are using. You should check the server's technical guide/manual to get the proper information. The following is an example.</p>
<p>We will use here the Dell R720 as an example since it is a popular 3node choice. In this case, we use the R720's <a href="https://downloads.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_ser_stor_net/esuprt_poweredge/poweredge-r720_reference-guide_en-us.pdf">Technical Guide</a> as reference.</p>
<p>For the R720, between 35˚C and 40˚C (or 95˚F and 104˚F), with 5% to 85% relative humidity, you can have this &lt;10% of annual operating hours (around 36 days per year), and between 40˚C and 45˚C (or 104˚F and 113˚F), with 5 to 90% relative humidity, it’s &lt;1% of annual operating hours (around 3.6 day per year). All this considers that there is no direct sunlight.</p>
<p>From 10˚C to 35˚C (thus from 50˚F to 95˚F), it’s considered standard operating temperature. With relative humidity from 10% to 80%.</p>
<p>This can give you a good idea of the conditions a 3node can handle, but make sure you verify with your specific server's manual.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="ensure-proper-air-changes-per-hour"><a class="header" href="#ensure-proper-air-changes-per-hour">Ensure Proper Air Changes per Hour</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>To ensure that the air changes per hour is optimal in your 3node servers' room, and depending on your current situation, it can be recommended to ventilate the server room in other to disperse or evacuate excess heat and humidity. In those cases, ventilation flow will be set depending on the air changes per hour (ACPH) needed. Note that the <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Technical%20Resources/Standards%20and%20Guidelines/Standards%20Addenda/62-2001/62-2001_Addendum-n.pdf">ASHRAE</a> recommends from 10 to 15 ACPH for a computer room.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: A good AC unit will be able to regulate the heat and the relative humidity as well as ensure proper air changes per hour.</p>

<h3 id="calculate-the-total-electricity-cost-of-your-farm"><a class="header" href="#calculate-the-total-electricity-cost-of-your-farm">Calculate the Total Electricity Cost of Your Farm</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>The total electricity cost of your farm is the sum of all Power used by your system times the price you pay for each kWh of power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Total electricity cost = Total Electricity in kWh * Cost per kWh</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Total Electricty in kWh = 3nodes' electricity consumption * Number of 3nodes + Cooling system electricity consumption</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With our example, we have 5 servers running at 400 W at Full Load and we have a 12K BTU unit that is consuming in average 1000W. </p>
<p>We would then have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 * 400 W + 1000 W = 3000 W = 3 kW</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get the kWh per day we simply multiply by 24. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>kW * (# of hour per day) = daily kWh consumption</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>3 kW * 24 = 72 kWh / day</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We thus have 72 kWH per day. For 30 days, this would be </p>
<blockquote>
<p>kWh / day * (# day in a month) = kWh per month</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>72 * 30 = 2160 kWH / month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a kWh price of 0.10$ USD, we have a cost of 216 $USD per month for the electricity bill of our Threefold farm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>kWH / month of the farm * kWh Cost = Electricity Bill per month for the farm</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2160 * 0.1 = 216$USD / month for electricity bills</p>

<h3 id="calculate-the-proper-bandwidth-needed-for-your-farm"><a class="header" href="#calculate-the-proper-bandwidth-needed-for-your-farm">Calculate the Proper Bandwidth Needed for Your Farm</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>The bandwidth needed for a given 3node is not yet set in stone and you are welcome to participate in ongoing <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/storage-bandwidth-ratio/1389">discussion on this subject</a> on the Threefold Forum.</p>
<p>In this section, we will give general guidelines. The goal is to have a good idea of what constitutes a proper bandwidth available for a given amount of resources utilized on the Threefold Grid.</p>
<p>Starting with a minimum of 1 mbps per Titan, which is 1 TB SSD and 32 GB RAM, we note that this is the lowest limit that gives the opportunity for the most people possible to join the Threefold Grid. That being said, we could set that 10 mbps is an acceptable upper limit for 1 TB SSD and 64 GB of RAM. </p>
<p>Those numbers are empirical and more information will be shared in the future. The ratio 1TB SSD/64GB RAM is in tune with the optimal TFT rewards ratio. It is thus logical to think that farmers will build 3node based on this ratio. Giving general bandwidth guidelines based on this ratio unit could thus be efficient for the current try-and-learn situation. </p>
<hr />
<h4 id="the-minimum-bandwidth-per-3node-equation"><a class="header" href="#the-minimum-bandwidth-per-3node-equation">The Minimum Bandwidth per 3node Equation</a></h4>
<hr />
<p>Here we explore some equations that can give a general idea to farmers of the bandwidth needed for their farms. As stated, this is not yet set in stones and the TFDAO will need to discuss and clarify those notions.</p>
<p>Here is a general equation that gives you a good idea of a correct bandwidth for a 3node:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>min Bandwidth per 3node (mbps) = k * max((Total SSD TB / 1 Tb),(Total Threads / 8 Threads),(Total GB / 64 GB)) + k * (Total HDD TB / 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Setting k = 10 mbps, we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>min Bandwidth per 3node (mbps) = 10 * max((Total SSD TB / 1 TB),(Total Threads / 8 Threads),(Total GB / 64 GB)) + 10 * (Total HDD TB / 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example, a Titan, with 1TB SSD, 8 Threads and 64 GB of RAM, would need 10 mbps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 * max(1, 1, 1) = 10 * 1 = 10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the last portion of the equation, we can see that for each additional 1TB HDD storage, you would need to add 5 mbps of bandwidth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let's take a big server as another example. Say we have a server with 5TB SSD, 48 threads and 384 GB of RAM. We would then need 60 mbps of bandwidth for each of these 3nodes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 * max((5/5), (48/8), (384/64)) = 10 * max(5,6,6) = 10 * 6 = 60</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This server would need 60 mbps minimum to account for a full TF Grid utilization.</p>
<p>You can easily scale this equation if you have many 3nodes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let's say you have a 1 gbps bandwidth from your Internet Service Provider (ISP). How much of those 3nodes could your farm have?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Floor (Total available bandwidth / ((Bandwidth needed per 3nodes)) = Max servers possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With our example we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1000 / 60 = 16.66... = 16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We note that the function Floor takes the integer without the decimals.</p>
<p>Thus, a 1 gbps bandwidth farm could have 16 3nodes with each 5TB SSD, 48 threads and 384 GB of RAM.</p>
<hr />
<p>In this section, we used <strong>k = 10 mbps</strong>. If you follow those guidelines, you will most probably have a decent bandwidth for your Threefold farm. For the time being, the goal is to have farmers building Threefold farms and scale them reasonably with their available bandwidth. </p>
<p>Stay tuned for official bandwidth parameters in the future.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="cost-per-month-for-a-given-bandwidth"><a class="header" href="#cost-per-month-for-a-given-bandwidth">Cost per Month for a Given Bandwidth</a></h4>
<hr />
<p>Once you know the general bandwidth needed for your farm, you can check with your ISP the price per month and take this into account when calculating your monthly costs.</p>
<p>Let's take the example we used with 5 servers with 400 W at Full Load. Let's say these 5 servers have the same parameters we used above here. We then need 60 gbps per 3nodes. This means we need 300 mbps. For the sake of our example, let's say this is around 100$ USD per month.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="calculate-the-total-cost-and-revenue"><a class="header" href="#calculate-the-total-cost-and-revenue">Calculate the Total Cost and Revenue</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>As the TFT price is fixed for 60 months when you connect your 3node for the first time on the TF Grid, we will use the period of 60 months, or 5 years, to calculate the total cost and revenue.</p>
<p>The total cost is equal to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Total Cost = Initial investment + 60 * (electricity + Internet costs per month)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our example, we can state that we paid each server 1500$ USD and that they generate each 3000 TFT per month, with an entry price of 0.08$ USD per TFT. </p>
<p>The electricity cost per month is </p>
<blockquote>
<p>144$ for the electricity bill</p>
<p>100$ for the Internet bill</p>
<p>Total : 244 $ monthly cost for electricity and Internet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The revenues are</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revenues per month = Number of 3nodes * TFT farmed per 3node * Price TFT Sold</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, we have 5 servers generating 2000 TFT per month at 0.08$ USD per TFT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 * 3000$ * 0.08$ = 1200$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The net revenue per month are thus equal to </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Net Revenue = Gross revenue - Monthly cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We thus have </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1200$ - 244$ = 956$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that we generate a net profit of 956$ per month, without considering the initial investment of building the 3nodes for the farm.</p>
<p>In the previous AC example, we calculate that a minimum of 12K BTU was needed for the AC system. Let's say that this would mean buying a 350$ USD 12k BTU AC unit.</p>
<p>The initial cost is the cost of all the 3nodes plus the AC system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of 3nodes * cost per 3nodes + Cost of AC system = Total Cost</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, it would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Total initial investment = Number of 3nodes * Cost of 3node + Cost of AC system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then we'd have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 * 1500 + 350 = 7850 $</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, a more realistic ROI would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Total initial investment / Net Revenue per Month = ROI in months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our case, we would have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7850$ / 956$ = Ceiling(8.211...) = 9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the function Ceiling taking the upper integer, without any decimals.</p>
<p>Then within 9 months, this farm would have paid itself and from now on, it would be only positive net revenue of 956$ per month.</p>
<p>We note that this takes into consideration that we are using the AC system 24/7. This would surely not be the case in real life. This means that the real ROI would be even better. It is a common practice to do estimates with stricter parameters. If you predict being profitable with strict parameters, you will surely be profitable in real life, even when &quot;things&quot; happen and not everything goes as planned. As always, this is not financial advice.</p>
<p>We recall that in the section <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#calculate-the-roi-of-a-diy-3node">Calculate the ROI of a DIY 3node</a>, we found a simpler ROI of 6.25 months, say 7 months, that wasn't taking into consideration the additional costs of Internet and electricity. We now have a more realistic ROI of 9 months based on a fixed TFT price of 0.08$ USD. You will need to use to equations and check with your current TF farm and 3nodes.</p>

<p>As a brief synthesis, the following equations are used to calculate the total revenues and costs of your farm.</p>
<pre><code>    - Total Monthly Cost = Electricity cost + Internet Cost
    - Total Electricity Used = Electricy per 3node * Number of 3node + Electricity for Cooling
    - Total Monthly Revenue = TFT farmed per 3 node * Number of 3nodes * TFT price when sold
    - Initial Investment = Price of farm (3nodes) + Price of AC system
    - Total Return on investment = (60 * Monthly Revenue) - (60 * Monthly cost) - Initial Investment

<h1 id="threefold-token-tft"><a class="header" href="#threefold-token-tft">Threefold Token (TFT)</a></h1>
<p>The Threefold Toke (TFT) is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, and application) on the ThreeFold Grid.</p>
<p>No ThreeFold Tokens have ever been minted. ThreeFold Tokens are generated through a process called “Farming”. Farming happens when active internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. Independent farmers earn ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) by providing neutral and decentralized internet capacity, thus expending the usable TF Grid. Therefore no central entity controls the internet.</p>
<h2 id="6-facts-about-the-threefold-tokens"><a class="header" href="#6-facts-about-the-threefold-tokens">6 Facts About the ThreeFold Tokens</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>TFTs are exclusively generated when new capacity is added to the TF Grid. There are no centralized issuers. Tokens have not been created out of thin air.</li>
<li>While the ThreeFold Grid can expand, a maximum of 4 Billion TFTs can ever be in circulation. This limit ensures stability of value and incentivization for all stakeholders.</li>
<li>TFT lives on the Stellar Blockchain. TFT holders benefit from a big ecosystem of proven wallets and mediums of exchange.</li>
<li>By employing Stellar technology, TFT transactions and smart contracts are powered by one of the most energy-efficient blockchains available. Furthermore, TFT is the medium of exchange on the greenest internet network in the world.</li>
<li>The market for farming, cultivating and trading TFT is open to all. Anyone with internet connection, power supply and necessary hardware can become a Farmer or trade ThreeFold tokens (TFT).</li>
<li>By farming, buying, holding, and utilizing ThreeFold Tokens, you are actively supporting the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid and its use cases — creating a more sustainable, fair, and equally accessible Internet.</li>

<p>The easiest way to send your farming rewards is to use the free Threefold Connect App. </p>
<p>It is available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threefold-connect/id1459845885">iOS</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that for Android phones, you need at minimum Android Nougat, the 8.0 software version.</li>
<li>Note that for iOS phones, you need at minimum iOS 14.5. It will be soon available to iOS 13.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4 id="threefold-connect-installation"><a class="header" href="#threefold-connect-installation">Threefold Connect Installation</a></h4>
<hr />
<p>Either use the links above, or search for the Threefold Connect App on the Apple Store or the Google Play store. Then install and open the app. If you want to leave a 5 star review of the App, no one here will stop you!</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_1.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_1" />
<img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_2.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_2" /></p>
<p>When you try to open the App, if you get an error message such as : &quot;Error in initialization in Flagsmith...&quot;, you might need to upgrade your phone to a newer software version (8.0 for Android and 13 for iOS).</p>
<p>Once you are in the application, you will see some introduction pages to help you familiarize with the TF Connect App. You will also be asked to read and accept Threefold's Terms and conditions.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_3.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_3" />
<img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_4.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_4" /></p>
<p>You will then be asked to either <em>SIGN UP</em> or <em>RECOVER ACCOUNT</em>. For now, we will show how to sign up. Later in the guide, we will show you how to recover an account.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_5.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_5" /></p>
<p>You will then be asked to choose a <em>Threefold Connect Id</em>. This ID will be used, as well as the seed phrase, when you want to recover an account. Choose wisely. And do not forget it! Here we will use TFExample, as an example.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_6.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_6" /></p>
<p>Next, you need to add a valid email address. This will be used as a broad KYC. You will need to access your email and confirm the validation email from Threefold to use properly the TF Connect App Wallet.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_7.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_7" /></p>
<p>Then, the next step is crucial! Make sure no one is around looking at your screen. You will be shown your seed phrase. Keep this in a secure and offline place. You will need the 3bot ID and the seed phrase to recover your account. This seed phrase is of utmost important. Do not lose it nor give it to anyone.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_8.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_8" /></p>
<p>Once you've hit Next, you will be asked to write down 3 random words of your seed phrase. This is a necessary step to ensure you have taken the time to write down your seed phrase.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_9.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_9" /></p>
<p>Then, you'll be asked to confirm your TF 3bot name and the associated email.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_10.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_10" /></p>
<p>Finally, you will be asked to choose a 4-digit pin. This will be needed to use the Threefold Connect App. If you ever forget this 4-digit pin, you will need to recover your account from your 3bot name and your seed phrase. You will need to confirm the new pin in the next step.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_11.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_11" /></p>
<p>That's it! You've created your Threefold Connect account. You can press the hamburger menu on the top left to explore the Threefold Connect App.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/./img/farming_tf_wallet_12.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_12" /></p>
<p>In the next step, we will create a Threefold Connect Wallet. You'll see, it's very simple!</p>

<hr />
<h5 id="send-tft"><a class="header" href="#send-tft">Send TFT</a></h5>
<hr />
<p>To send tokens, select <em>Send Coins</em> in the wallet section. To send TFT, you can scan the QR code of the address you wish to send tokens to. This will enter automatically the necessary information. Make sure to double check that the information is correct to avoid any complications. Otherwise, you can simply enter the correct address in the section <em>To</em>. Choose the amount you want to send. Then click on <em>SEND TOKENS</em>. </p>
<p>Note that, for such transactions, there is a maximum fee of 0.10 TFT on the Stellar blockchain, and a maximum fee of 0.01 TFT on the TFChain. This amount is taken from the amount you are sending. It is not taken directly in your wallet. </p>
<hr />
<h5 id="receive-tft"><a class="header" href="#receive-tft">Receive TFT</a></h5>
<hr />
<p>To receive tokens, select <em>Receive Coins</em> in the wallet section. To receive TFT, you can generate a QR code to share to the person waiting to send you tokens. Otherwise, the sender can simply use your Stellar or TFChain address and send you TFT.</p>
<p>To generate the QR Code, select the chain you want to use, Stellar or TFChain, enter the amount and the message if needed and click on <em>GENERATE QR CODE</em>. Note that there is no message option for TFChain, only for Stellar. This will generate a QR Code that can be scanned by other devices.</p>

<p>First, <a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download">download Ledger Live</a> and download the Stellar application in <strong>Manager</strong>. Then, go on an official Stellar website such as <a href="https://stellarterm.com/">Stellarterm</a> or <a href="https://www.stellarx.com/">StellarX</a>. For this example, we will be using Stellarterm.com.</p>
<p>Unlock your Ledger by entering your digit password.</p>
<p>Select the Stellar App.</p>
<p>In our case, we do not need to create an account on Stellerterm, since we are using a hardware wallet.</p>

<hr />
<p>In short, there is the <a href="https://bridge.bsc.threefold.io/">BSC-Stellar Bridge</a> and the <a href="https://portal.grid.tf/">TF Chain-Stellar</a> Bridge.</p>
<p>The BSC-Stellar Bridge is used to go between the Stellar Chain and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
The TFChain-Stellar Bridge is used to go between Stellar Chain and TF Chain.</p>
<p>To go from BSC to TF Chain, or from TF Chain to BSC, you need to use the two bridges.</p>
<p>BSC can be used to sell/buy TFT while TF Chain can be used to deploy Dapps on https://play.grid.tf</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Always start with a small amount the first time you try a bridge.</p>

<hr />
<p>In general, to set up a Stellar address to transact TFT on Stellar chain, you can use any Stellar wallet that has a TFT trustline enabled. Note that on Stellar chain, fees are paid in XLM. </p>
<p>The easiest way is to simply create an account on the Threefold Connect App (for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threefold-connect/id1459845885">iOS</a>) and to then use the TFT wallet of the app, which has by default a TFT trustline on Stellar chain and also comes with 1 XLM sponsored by Threefold for transaction fees.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-the-bsc-stellar-bridge"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-the-bsc-stellar-bridge">How to use the BSC-Stellar Bridge</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>To use the BSC-Stellar Bridge, follow the following steps. If this is your first time with MetaMask and BSC, read the section <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#setting-up-tft-on-metamask">Setting up TFT on Metamask</a>.</p>
<p>It will cost 50 TFT* to bridge from Stellar to BSC, and 1 TFT to bridge from BSC to Stellar. There is also a fixed fee of 0.01 TFT when using the Stellar blockchain. Those fees are taken from the total of what you are bridging. </p>
<p>*For example, if you Bridge 80 TFT, from Stellar to BSC, you will receive 30 TFT.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The bridge will process deposits/withdrawals within 48 hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h4 id="bridge-from-stellar-to-bsc"><a class="header" href="#bridge-from-stellar-to-bsc">Bridge from Stellar to BSC</a></h4>
<hr />
<p><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Metamask account</li>
<li>TF Connect App+Wallet</li>
<li>TFT on Stellar Blockchain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the BSC-Stellar <a href="https://bridge.bsc.threefold.io/">Bridge website</a>.</li>
<li>Connect your MetaMask Wallet.</li>
<li>Sign in with MetaMask.</li>
<li>Choose the option  <em>Deposit from Stellar</em>.</li>
<li>Agree to the  <em>Threefold Terms</em>.</li>
<li>Read and tick the box of the  <em>Warning Message</em>.</li>
<li>On your phone, open up your Threefold Connect App and go to the wallet section.</li>
<li>Select the option  <em>Send</em>.</li>
<li>Select the  <em>Stellar</em>  chain.</li>
<li>Click on the button  <em>Scan QR Code</em> . The QR Code option automatically fill up your  <em>MESSAGE</em>.</li>
<li>Scan the QR code that appears on the Bridge window (or write the information manually).</li>
<li>Make sure the  <em>MESSAGE</em>  is correctly entered.</li>
<li>Press  <em>Send Tokens</em>.</li>
<li>Press  <em>Confirm</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this method, you use the Bridge directly. Thus, it is normal if you do not see your standard MetaMask address. MetaMask is on ERC20 and TFT is on Stellar. You are sending TFT to the Bridge's address, and the Bridge sends money to your wallet afterward.</p>

<p>The Threefold Connect App is available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threefold-connect/id1459845885">iOS</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that for Android phones, you need at minimum Android Nougat, the 8.0 software version.</li>
<li>Note that for iOS phones, you need at minimum iOS 14.5. It will be soon available to iOS 13.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either use the links above, or search for the Threefold Connect App on the Apple Store or the Google Play store. Then install and open the app. If you want to leave a 5 star review of the App, no one here will stop you!</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_1.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_1" /></p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_2.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_2" /></p>
<p>Once you are in the application, you will see some introduction pages to help you familiarize with the TF Connect App. You will also be asked to read and accept Threefold's Terms and conditions.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_4.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_4" /></p>
<p>You will then be asked to either <em>SIGN UP</em> or <em>RECOVER ACCOUNT</em>. For now, we will show how to sign up. Later in the guide, we will show you how to recover an account.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_5.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_5" /></p>
<p>You will then be asked to choose a <em>Threefold Connect Id</em>. This ID will be used, as well as the seed phrase, when you want to recover an account. Choose wisely. And do not forget it! Here we will use TFExample, as an example.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_6.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_6" /></p>
<p>Next, you need to add a valid email address. This will be used as a broad KYC. You will need to access your email and confirm the validation email from Threefold to use properly the TF Connect App Wallet.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_7.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_7" /></p>
<p>Then, the next step is crucial! Make sure no one is around looking at your screen. You will be shown your seed phrase. Keep this in a secure and offline place. You will need the 3bot ID and the seed phrase to recover your account. This seed phrase is of utmost important. Do not lose it nor give it to anyone.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_8.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_8" /></p>
<p>Once you've hit Next, you will be asked to write down 3 random words of your seed phrase. This is a necessary step to ensure you have taken the time to write down your seed phrase.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_9.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_9" /></p>
<p>Then, you'll be asked to confirm your TF 3bot name and the associated email.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_10.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_10" /></p>
<p>Finally, you will be asked to choose a 4-digit pin. This will be needed to use the Threefold Connect App. If you ever forget this 4-digit pin, you will need to recover your account from your 3bot name and your seed phrase. You will need to confirm the new pin in the next step.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_11.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_11" /></p>
<p>That's it! You've created your Threefold Connect account. You can press the hamburger menu on the top left to explore the Threefold Connect App.</p>

<p>To create a farm, follow those steps.</p>
<p>Click on the hamburger menu on the top left of your screen and select <em>Farmer Migration</em>. This title is somehow misleading, as you can not only migrate farms, but create farms too!</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_24.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_24" /></p>
<p>To create a farm, either click on the <em>plus</em> sign at the top right, or click on <em>Click to create -&gt;</em>.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_25.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_25" /></p>
<p>To create a farm, choose the wallet associated with the farm. Also, choose a Farm Name then read and accept the Terms and Conditions. Finally, click <em>submit</em>.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_26.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_26" /></p>
<p>The TF Connect App will give you a confirmation message if the farm was created successfully. If it doesn't work the first time, make sure you have a good Internet connection and try again. If you click on the down arrow, you will be able to see your <em>Farm Information</em>.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_27.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_27" /></p>
<p>You can see on this screen the address were your farming rewards will be sent to. It is the Stellar address associated with the Threefold Wallet used to create the farm.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/./img/farming_tf_wallet_28.png" alt="farming_tf_wallet_28" /></p>
<p>We can see on the picture above that the Farm ID here is 1821. The farm ID will be used to create the Zero-OS Bootstrap Image in the next section.</p>

<p>In this case, the disk we want to wipe is <em>sda</em>.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_desktop/img/3node_diy_desktop_72.png" alt="3node_diy_desktop_72.png" /></p>

<p>Before booting the main operating system, in our case Zero-OS, a computer will boot in either BIOS or UEFI mode. Older systems use BIOS and newer systems uses UEFI. Both BIOS and UEFI are low-lewel softwares needed to interact between the hardware and the main OS of the computer. Note that BIOS is also called Legacy BIOS.</p>

<hr />
<p>There are certain things that you should make sure are set properly on your 3Node.</p>
<p>As a general advice, you can Load Defaults (Settings) on your BIOS, then make sure the options below are set properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the correct combination of BIOS/UEFI and bootstrap image on <a href="https://bootstrap.grid.tf/">https://bootstrap.grid.tf/</a>
<ul>
<li>Newer system will use UEFI --&gt; the Dell Optiplex 7020 uses UEFI
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap image: <em>EFI IMG</em> and <em>EFI FILE</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Older system will use Legacy BIOS
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap image: <em>ISO</em> and <em>USB</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set <em>Multi-Processor</em> and <em>Hyperthreading</em> at Enabled
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, it will be written <em>Virtual Cores</em>, or <em>Logical Cores</em>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set <em>Virtualization</em> at Enabled
<ul>
<li>On Intel, it is denoted as <em>CPU virtualization</em> and on ASUS, it is denoted as <em>SVM</em>. </li>
<li>Make sure virtualization is enabled and look for the precise terms in your specific BIOS/UEFI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enable <em>Network Stack</em> (sometimes called <em>Network Boot</em>)</li>
<li>Set <em>AC Recovery</em> at <em>Last Power State</em>
<ul>
<li>This will make sure your 3Node restarts after losing power momentarily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select the proper <em>Boot Sequence</em> for the 3Node to boot Zero-OS from your bootstrap image
<ul>
<li>e.g., if you have a USB key as a bootstrap image, select it in <em>Boot Sequence</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set <em>Server Lookup Method</em> (or the equivalent) at <em>DNS</em>.
<ul>
<li>Only use Static IP if you know what you are doing.</li>
<li>Your router will automatically assign a dynamic IP address to your 3Node when it connects to Internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set <em>Client Address Method</em> (or the equivalent) at <em>DHCP</em>. Only use Static IP if you know what you are doing.
<ul>
<li>Your router will automatically assign a dynamic IP address to your 3Node when it connects to Internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Secure Boot</em> should be left at disabled

</li>
<li>Verify the 3Node's status on Threefold Explorer</li>
</ol>
<p>The first time you boot a 3Node, it will be written: “This node is not registered (farmer ***: NameOfFarm). This is normal. The Grid will create a node ID and you will be able to see it on screen. This can take a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>This is the final screen you should see when your 3Node is connected to the Threefold Grid. Note that it is normal if it is written <em>no public config</em> next to <em>PUB</em> as we did not set any public IP address.</p>
<p>Naturally, your node ID as well as your farm ID and name will be shown.</p>

<p>Some will recommend to wear anti-static gloves as shown here. If you don’t have anti-static gloves, remember this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always touch the metal side of the server before manipulating the hardware. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your hands will discharge the static on the outside of the box, which is secure.</p>

<p>Here is one of the two 2TB SSD NVME m.2 that we will install on the server. Above the SSD is the PCIe Gen 3, x4 that we will use to connect the SSD to the server.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_4.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_4" /></p>
<p>You can see at the left of the adaptor that there is a metal piece that can be used to hold more firmly the PCIe adaptor and the SSD. We will remove it for this DIY build. Why? Because it is not necessary as the adaptor can hold the weight of the SSD. Also, this metal piece is full while the brackets in the server have holes in it. This will ensure a better airflow and thus less heat.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_5.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_5" /></p>
<p>We remove the screws with a star screwdriver.</p>

<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_7.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_7" /></p>
<p>This SSD already has a heatsink. There is no need to use the heatsink included in the PCIe adaptor kit. If you remove the heatsink or the sticker under the SSD, you will lose your 5 years warranty.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_8.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_8" /></p>
<p>When you put the SSD in the adaptor, make sure you have the opening in line with the adaptor.</p>

<p>Fitting in the SSD takes some force. Do not overdo it and take your time!</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_11.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_11" /></p>
<p>It’s normal that the unscrewed part is lifting in the air before you screw the SSD on the adaptor.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_12.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_12" /></p>
<p>To screw the SSD in place, use the screwdriver included in the PCIe adaptor kit.</p>

<p>Lift up the lock and the top server plate should glide to the back. You can remove the top of the server.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_18.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_18" /></p>
<p>Here’s the full story! R620 and all!</p>

<p>To remove this plastic piece, simply lift with your fingers at the designated spot (follow the blue line!).</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_22.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_22" /></p>
<p>Here’s the RAMs! This R620 came already equipped with 256GB of rams dispersed in 16x16GB sticks. If you need to add the RAM sticks yourself, make sure you are doing it correctly. The FAQ covers some basic information for RAM installation.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_23.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_23" /></p>
<p>To remove a stick, push on the clips on both sides. You can do it one at a time if you want. Make sure it doesn’t pop out and fall on a hardware piece! Once the clips are opened, pull out the RAM stick by holding it on the sides. This will ensure it does not get damaged.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_24.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_24" /></p>
<p>Here’s the RAM in it’s purest form!</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_25.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_25" /></p>
<p>Here you can see that the gap is not in the middle of the RAM stick. You must be careful when inserting the RAM. Make sure you have the gap aligned with the RAM holder.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_26.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_26" /></p>
<p>When you want to put a RAM stick in its slot, make sure the plastic holders on the sides are opened and insert the RAM stick. Make sure you align the RAM stick properly. You can then push on one side at a time until the RAM stick clicks in. You can do it both sides at once if you are at ease.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="general-rules-when-installing-ram-sticks"><a class="header" href="#general-rules-when-installing-ram-sticks">General Rules when Installing RAM Sticks</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>First, always use RAM sticks of the same size and type. It should be noted on your motherboard which slots to populate first. </p>
<p>As a general guide, there is usually 2 slots A and B, with each 2 memory stick entries. You must then install the ram sticks on A1 and B1 in order to achieve dual channel, then A2 and B2 if you have more (visual order: A1 A2 B1 B2).</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="procedure-to-install-ram-sticks"><a class="header" href="#procedure-to-install-ram-sticks">Procedure to Install RAM Sticks</a></h4>
<hr />
<p>You want to start with your largest sticks, evenly distributed between both processors and work your way down to your smallest. </p>
<p>As an example, let's say you have 2 processors and 4x 16GB sticks and 4x 8GB sticks. The arrangement would be A1-16GB, B1-16GB, A2-16GB, B2-16GB, A3-8GB, B3-8GB, A4-8GB, B4-8GB. </p>
<p>Avoid odd numbers as well. You optimally want pairs. So if you only have 5x 8GB sticks, only install 4 until you have an even 6.</p>
<h2 id="installing-the-ssd-disks"><a class="header" href="#installing-the-ssd-disks">Installing the SSD Disks</a></h2>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_27.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_27" /></p>
<p>To put back the plastic protector, simply align the plastic piece with the two nudges in the metal case.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_28.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_28" /></p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_29.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_29" /></p>
<p>We will now remove this PCIe riser in order to connect the SSDs.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_30.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_30" /></p>
<p>Optional step: put the SSDs and the PCIe riser next to each other so they can talk and break the ice. They will get to learn one another before going into the server to farm TFT.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_31.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_31" /></p>
<p>Just like with RAM sticks, you want to make sure you are aligned with the slot.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_32.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_32" /></p>
<p>Next, push the adaptor inside the riser’s opening. This takes some force too. If you are well aligned, it should be done with ease.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_33.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_33" /></p>
<p>This is what the riser looks like with the two SSDs installed. Now you simply need to put the riser back inside the server.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_34.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_34" /></p>
<p>Push down on the riser to insert it properly.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_35.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_35" /></p>
<p>It’s good to notice that the inside of the top plate of the server has great pictures showing how to manipulate the hardware.</p>
<h2 id="plugging-the-3node-server"><a class="header" href="#plugging-the-3node-server">Plugging the 3node Server</a></h2>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_36.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_36" /></p>
<p>Now you will want to plug in the power cable in the PSU. Here we show two 495W PSUs. With 256GB of RAM and two SSDs NVME, it is better to use two 750W PSUs. Note that this server will only use around 100W at idle. There are two power cables for redundancy. The unit does not need more than one to function.</p>
<p>On a 15A/120V breaker, you can have more than one server. But note that, at full load, this server can use up to 400W. In this case, no more than 3 servers could be plugged on the same breaker. Make sure you adapt to your current situation (server's power consumption, electric breaker, etc.).</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_37.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_37" /></p>
<p>Plugging in the power cable is pretty straightforward. Just make sure you have the 3 pins oriented properly!</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_38.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_38" /></p>
<p>It is highly recommended to plug the power cable in a surge protector. If you have unsteady electricity at your location, it might be good to use a UPS, uninterrupted power supply. A surge protector is essential to avoid overpowering and damaging the server.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_39.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_39" /></p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_40.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_40" /></p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_41.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_41" /></p>
<p>Before starting the server, you can plug in the monitor and the keyboard as well as the ethernet cable. Make sure you plug the ethernet cable in one of the four NIC ports.</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_42.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_42" /></p>
<p>Now, power it on!</p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_43.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_43" /></p>
<p>The server is booting.</p>
<h2 id="removing-the-dvd-optical-drive---installing-a-ssd-disk-in-the-dvd-optical-drive-slot"><a class="header" href="#removing-the-dvd-optical-drive---installing-a-ssd-disk-in-the-dvd-optical-drive-slot">Removing the DVD Optical Drive - Installing a SSD disk in the DVD Optical Drive Slot</a></h2>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_44.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_44" /></p>
<p><img src="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server/./img/3node_diy_rack_server_45.png" alt="3node_diy_rack_server_45" /></p>
<p>If you want to change the DVD optical drive, push where indicated and remove the power and SATA cables. </p>
<p>It is possible to install a SSD disk in there. To do so, use a SATA HDD hard drive caddy CD/DVD <strong>9.5mm</strong> and put in a SATA III 2.5&quot; disk. The caddy is not necessary. You could simply remove the standard CD/DVD caddy and plug the SATA disk.</p>
<p>The hardware part is done. Next, you will want to set the BIOS properly as well as get the bootstrap image of Zero-OS. Before we get into this, let's have some information on using the onboard storage of your 3node server.</p>
<h2 id="using-onboard-storage---raid-controller-details"><a class="header" href="#using-onboard-storage---raid-controller-details">Using Onboard Storage - RAID Controller Details</a></h2>
<p>If you want to use the onboard storage on your server, you will probably need to flash the RAID card or do some adjustment in order for Zero-OS to recognize your disks.</p>
<p>You can use the onboard storage on a server without RAID. You can <a href="https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html">re-flash</a>  the RAID card, turn on HBA/non-RAID mode, or install a different card. It's usually easy to set servers such as a HP Proliant with the HBA mode. </p>
<p>For Dell servers, you can either cross-flash the RAID controller with an “IT-mode-Firmware” (see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5nb09VksYw">video</a>) or get a DELL H310-controller (which has the non-RAID option). Otherwise, as shown in this guide, you can install a NVME SSD with a PCIe adaptor, and turn off the RAID controller.</p>
<p>Note that for Dell R610 and R710, you can re-flash the RAID card. For the R910, you can’t re-flash the card. In this case, you will need to get a LSI Dell card.</p>
<h1 id="zero-os-bootstrap-image"><a class="header" href="#zero-os-bootstrap-image">Zero-OS Bootstrap Image</a></h1>
<p>With R620 and R720 Dell servers, UEFI does not work well. You will want to use either a DVD or a USB in BIOS mode.</p>
<p>Go on https://bootstrap.grid.tf/ and download the appropriate image: option <strong>ISO</strong> for the DVD and option <strong>USB</strong> for BIOS USB (not UEFI).</p>
<p>Write your farmer ID and make sure you select production mode.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-threefold-farm"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-threefold-farm">Creating a Threefold Farm</a></h2>

<hr />
<h3 id="dvd-iso-bios-image"><a class="header" href="#dvd-iso-bios-image">DVD ISO BIOS Image</a></h3>
<p>For the ISO image, download the file and burn it on a DVD.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="usb-bios-image"><a class="header" href="#usb-bios-image">USB BIOS Image</a></h3>
<p>Note: the USB key must be formatted before burning the Zero-OS bootstrap image.</p>
<p>For Windows, MAC and Linux, you can use <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">balenaEtcher</a>, a free and open source software that will let you create a bootstrap image on a USB key, while also formatting the USB key at the same time. </p>
<p>This is the <strong>easiest way</strong> to burn your Zero-OS bootstrap image. All the steps are clearly explained within the software.</p>
<hr />
<p>For Windows, you can also use Rufus.</p>
<hr />
<p>For the USB image, with Linux, you can also go through the command window and write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dd status=progress if=FILELOCATION.ISO(or .IMG) of=/dev/sd*. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the * is to indicate that you must adjust according to your disk. To see your disks, write <strong>lsblk</strong> in the command window. Make sure you select the proper disk. </p>
<h1 id="bios-settings"><a class="header" href="#bios-settings">BIOS Settings</a></h1>
<p>Before starting the server, plug in the USB bootstrap image. You can also insert the DVD once the server is on.</p>
<p>When you start the server, press F2 to get into System Setup.</p>
<p>Then, select System BIOS. In System BIOS settings, select Processor Settings.</p>
<p>Note: More details are available for BIOS Settings in this <a href="TF_Farmer_Guide/3node_diy_rack_server//farming/farming.html#bios-mode">documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="processor-settings"><a class="header" href="#processor-settings">Processor Settings</a></h2>
<p>Make sure you have enabled the Logical Processor (Hyper Threading with HP). This turns 8 cores into 16 virtual cores. You can set QPI Speed at Maximum data rate. Make sure you set All to Number of Cores per Processor. You can adjust the Processor Core speed and Processor Bus Speed for specific uses.</p>
<p>It is also good to take a look at the Processors and make sure the hardware is correct.</p>
<h2 id="boot-settings"><a class="header" href="#boot-settings">Boot Settings</a></h2>
<p>Go to System BIOS Settings and select Boot Settings. In Boot Settings, choose BIOS and not UEFI as the Boot Mode. You need to save your preferences and comeback to select BIOS Boot Settings.</p>
<p>Once back in BIOS Boot Settings, go to Boot Sequence. Depending on your bootstrap image of Zero-OS, select either the USB key or the Optical Drive CD-DVD option. The name of the USB key can be Drive C or else depending on where you plugged it and your server model.</p>
<p>You can also disable the booting options that are not need. It can be good to have a DVD and a USB key with the bootstrap images for redundancy. If one boot fails, the computer would try with the other options of the boot sequence. This can be done with 2 USB keys too.</p>
<p>Boot Sequence Retry enabled will simply redo the booting sequence if the last time did not work.</p>

<p>That's it. You've set the BIOS settings properly and now is time to boot the 3node and connect to the Threefold Grid.</p>
<p>You can then save your preferences and exit. Your server should restart and load the bootstrap image. </p>
<h1 id="booting-the-3node"><a class="header" href="#booting-the-3node">Booting the 3node</a></h1>
<p>Once you've set the BIOS settings and restarted your computer, it will download the Zero-OS bootstrap image. This takes a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>The first time you boot a 3node, it will be written: “This node is not registered (farmer ***: NameOfFarm). This is normal. The Grid will create a node ID and you will be able to see it on screen. This can take a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Once you have your node ID, you can also go on the Threefold Explorer to see your 3node and verify that the connection is recognized by the Explorer.</p>

<p>Note that the main difference between the R620 and the R720 is that the former is a 1U and the latter a 2U. 2U servers are usually less noisy and generate less heat than 1U servers since they have a greater volume. In the R720, fans are bigger and thus less noisy. This can be an important factor to consider. Both offer great performances and work well with Zero-OS.</p>

<p>Different CPUs and RAMs configurations are possible for the Dell R620/R720 servers.</p>
<p>For example, you could replace the E5-2640 v2 CPUs for the E5-2695 V2. This would give you 48 Threads. You could then go with 12x32GB DDR3 LRDIMM. You would also need 5TB SSD total instead to get the proper ratio, which is 100GB of SSD and 8GB of RAM per virtual core (also called thread or logical core).</p>
<p>Note that you cannot have more than 16 sticks of ECC DIMM on the R620/R720. For more sticks, you need LRDIMM as stated above. </p>

<p>Welcome to the New Internet!</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="farmerbot"><a class="header" href="#farmerbot">Farmerbot</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the farmerbot. The farmerbot is a service that a farmer can run in order to automatically manage the nodes in his or her farm. </p>
<p>The key feature of the farmerbot is powermanagement. The farmerbot will automatically shutdown nodes from its farm whenever possible and bring them back on using Wake-on-Lan (WOL) when they are needed. It will try to maximize downtime as much as possible by recommending which nodes to use, this is one of the requests that the farmerbot can handle. All this behavior is customizable through markup definition files. </p>
<p>The sections on this page will guide you through the requirements, the required configuration and the steps to run the farmerbot.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-3"><a class="header" href="#requirements-3">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The farmerbot is shipped inside a docker image so that it is easy to run in a docker environment. Thus, the one and only requirement to run the farmerbot is docker so please <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">install docker</a> on your vm or system. Next, you'll have to copy the <a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/farmerbot/blob/development/docker-compose.yaml">docker-compose file</a> that will start the farmerbot for you when executing the command specified in section <a href="farmerbot/farmerbot.html#running-the-farmerbot">Running the farmerbot</a>.</p>
<h2 id="configuration"><a class="header" href="#configuration">Configuration</a></h2>
<p>Some configuration is required before running the farmerbot which should happen in a markdown file (<em>farmerbot.md</em> for example). This file should be located inside a folder called <em>config</em> in the directory of the docker-compose file. The possible configuration will be discussed in this section.</p>
<h3 id="node-configuration"><a class="header" href="#node-configuration">Node configuration</a></h3>
<p>The farmerbot can only manage the nodes that you define in the configuration. So, for each node in your farm, fill in these required attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>id: the id of the node</li>
<li>twinid: the twin id of the node</li>
</ul>
<p>Next to the required attributes you can provide the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>never_shutdown: a value telling the farmerbot whether or not the node should never be shutdown</li>
<li>cpuoverprovision: a value between 1 and 4 defining how much the cpu can be overprovisioned (2 means the farmerbot will allocate 2 deployments to one cpu)</li>
<li>public_config: a value telling the farmerbot whether or not the node has a public config</li>
<li>dedicated: a value telling the farmerbot whether or not the node is dedicated (only allow renting the full node)</li>
<li>certified: a value telling the farmerbot whether or not the node is certified</li>
</ul>
<p>The snippet below shows you an example of a node definition in the markdown config file:</p>
<pre><code>!!farmerbot.nodemanager.define
    id:20
    twinid:105
    public_config:true
    dedicated:1
    certified:yes
    cpuoverprovision:1
</code></pre>
<h3 id="farm-configuration"><a class="header" href="#farm-configuration">Farm configuration</a></h3>
<p>Two more settings are required regarding the farm:</p>
<ul>
<li>id: the id of the farm</li>
<li>public_ips: the amount of public ips that the farm has</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of the farm definition in the markdown config file:</p>
<pre><code>!!farmerbot.farmmanager.define
    id:3
    public_ips:2
</code></pre>
<h3 id="power-configuration"><a class="header" href="#power-configuration">Power configuration</a></h3>
<p>Finally, you can add some configuration that will the behavior of the farmerbot regarding the powermanagement of the nodes. The following attributes can be added to the markdown config file:</p>
<ul>
<li>wake_up_threshold: a value between 50 and 80 defining the threshold at which nodes will be powered on or off. If the usage percentage (total used resources devided by the total amount of resources) is greater then this threshold a new node will be powered on. In the other case the farmerbot will try to power off nodes if possible.</li>
<li>periodic_wakeup: nodes have to be woken up once a day, this variable defines the time at which this should happen. The offline nodes will be powered on sequentially with an interval of 5 minutes starting at the time defined by this variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of the power definition in the markdown config file:</p>
<pre><code>!!farmerbot.powermanager.define
    wake_up_threshold:75
    periodic_wakeup:8:30AM
</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-of-a-configuration-file"><a class="header" href="#example-of-a-configuration-file">Example of a configuration file</a></h3>
<p>Below you will find an example of a markdown config file for a farm with 3 nodes and 2 public ips. The first node has a public config, is dedicated, is certified and has a cpu overprovisioning of 2. The wake up threshold is set to 75% and the periodic wakeup will happen at 8:30AM.</p>
<pre><code>My nodes
!!farmerbot.nodemanager.define
    id:20
    twinid:105
    public_config:true
    dedicated:1
    certified:yes
    cpuoverprovision:2

!!farmerbot.nodemanager.define
    id:21
    twinid:106

!!farmerbot.nodemanager.define
    id:22
    twinid:107

Farm configuration
!!farmerbot.farmmanager.define
    id:3
    public_ips:2

Power configuration
!!farmerbot.powermanager.define
    wake_up_threshold:75
    periodic_wakeup:8:30AM
</code></pre>
<h2 id="running-the-farmerbot"><a class="header" href="#running-the-farmerbot">Running the farmerbot</a></h2>
<p>Once the configuration is done you should create a <em>.env</em> file (next to the docker-compose file) with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>MNEMONIC=&quot;&lt;THE_MNEMONIC_OF_YOUR_FARM&gt;&quot;
NETWORK=dev
RELAY=wss://relay.dev.grid.tf:443
SUBSTRATE=wss://tfchain.dev.grid.tf:443
</code></pre>
<p>Please modify the fields to what is required: you should fill in the mnemonic of your farm, choose the appropriate network and modify the relay and substrate values if need be (test instead of dev if your farm is running on testnet, etc). Now to run the the farmerbot just run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>docker compose up -d
</code></pre>
<p>The farmerbot should be running after a couple of seconds. It will create a log file inside your config folder called <em>farmerbot.log</em>. If you wish to restart a running farmerbot you can run the command shown below. It can take a couple of seconds before the farmerbot is completely shutdown. But before doing that it might be good to copy or delete the old log file.</p>
<pre><code>docker compose restart
</code></pre>
<p>If the docker-compose file has changed and you wish to run the new version you will have to copy the new docker-compose file, stop the running farmerbot and start the new farmerbot. Or just run the command (copy or delete the log file first):</p>
<pre><code>docker compose rm -f -s &amp;&amp; docker compose up -d
</code></pre>
<p>This again will take a couple of seconds.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-the-threefold-blockchain"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-the-threefold-blockchain">What is the the Threefold blockchain?</a></h3>
<p>ThreeFold blockchain is the layer 0 infrastructure for an open source peer-to-peer (P2P) Internet owned by humanity.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-architecture-of-the-threefold-grid-in-simple-terms"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-architecture-of-the-threefold-grid-in-simple-terms">What is the architecture of the Threefold Grid in simple terms?</a></h3>
<p>Essentially, the Threefold Grid is composed of the people using it, the 3node servers offering compute, storage and network resources, and the TF Chain, which is the blockchain of Threefold.</p>
<p>Middleware is also used, such as GraphQL and GrixProxy, to get and organize data from the Threefold Chain.
Middleware helps to make data available and to manage load.</p>
<p>3nodes store workloads data and can report on their state to the TF Grid and to middleware.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-threefold-token-what-are-the-uses-of-the-threefold-token-tft"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-threefold-token-what-are-the-uses-of-the-threefold-token-tft">What is the Threefold Token? What are the uses of the Threefold token (TFT)?</a></h3>
<p>ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, applications) on the ThreeFold Network – generated only when active capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.
It has a specific commercial utility, since ThreeFold Tokens were conceived as the designated currency for buying and selling capacity on the ThreeFold Grid.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-are-threefold-token-tft-produced"><a class="header" href="#how-are-threefold-token-tft-produced">How are Threefold Token (TFT) produced?</a></h3>
<p>ThreeFold Tokens are exclusively produced through a process called farming, which means that TFT are generated only when new Internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. There is no wasteful mining.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-are-the-tft-managed"><a class="header" href="#how-are-the-tft-managed">How are the TFT managed?</a></h3>
<p>TFT are managed by the ThreeFold Blockchain (“TF Chain”). </p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-internet-capacity-and-connectivity-does-threefold-replace-my-internet-service-provider-isp"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-internet-capacity-and-connectivity-does-threefold-replace-my-internet-service-provider-isp">What is the difference between Internet capacity and connectivity? Does ThreeFold replace my Internet service provider (ISP)?</a></h3>
<p>In simple terms, the Internet is composed of both capacity and connectivity. Capacity is where the data and resources are being handled, for example in servers. Connectivity is the infrastructure that transfer data and resources between servers. The latter is linked to the typical Internet service provider (ISP).</p>
<p>ThreeFold’s technology enables distributed capacity generation, but Threefold doesn’t deal in connectivity.
3nodes offer Internet capacity, but farmers still rely on connectivity provider like the usual Internet service provider (ISP).</p>

<p>Quantum computers are theoretically capable of doing huge calculations in a short period of time. By this fact alone, it is a great potential threat to future online safety. Threefold solves this future problem before it even becomes a reality. Indeed, Zero-os can compress, encrypt, and disperse data across the Grid.

Can a QSFS instance be reattached to another VM to recover it?</a></h3>
<p>QSFS is built from storage devices which are distributed and decentralized.</p>
<p>The storage engine is a software running on a VM that can run everywhere.
If the storage engine needs to run on a different VM the config needs to pushed to the new VM.
In short, yes Quantum safe file system (QSFS) can be recovered on a different VM. It is not automated yet on Zero-OS. A video tutorial will be shared soon.</p>

How is the Threefold Token (TFT) distributed when there is utilization on the Threefold Grid?</a></h3>
<p>Here are the general steps of the Proof-of-Utilization process:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user reserves Internet capacity on a given set of <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__3node">3Nodes</a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__zos">Zero-OS</a> records the reserved and used CU, SU, NU and IPAddresses in correlation with <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__tfchain">TFChain</a> records. </li>
<li>The TFChain <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__dao">DAO</a> will charge the costs to the user in line with <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__staking_discount_levels">discount mechanism</a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__threefold_token">TFT</a> from the user account are burned/distributed in line to table below.</li>
</ol>
<p>When people spend Threefold Tokens on the Threefold Grid for any kind of deployment, the TFT is distributed as per the Proof-of-Utilization distribution flow. </p>
<p>The Proof-of-Utilization distribution flow is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% goes to solution providers and sales channels*</li>
<li>35% goes to TFT burning</li>
<li>10% goes to the Threefold Foundation</li>
<li>5% goes to the Validator Staking Pool</li>
</ul>
<p>To see the Proof-of-Utilization distribution flow chart, check this <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tokens/threefold__token_overview">link</a>.</p>
<p>*Note: For billing purposes, ThreeFold DAO will check if the workload comes from a known sales channel and/or solution provider. If yes, then the billing smart contract code will know how to distribute the TFTs. If the sales channel and/or solution provider is not known, then the 50% will go to a DAO owned Community Grant Wallet.</p>

<p>Stellar is basically a payment network. But we also need a decentralized way to store the full infrastructure of farms, nodes, contracts, billing reports etc. This is available now on TFChain, as you can see <a href="https://graphql.grid.tf/graphql">here</a>. </p>
<p>Stellar remains very good when it's purely about fast payment, while TF Chain is used as the decentralized blockchain of the New Internet.</p>
<p>It's why both remain active, with a bridge in-between to enable transfer of the same tokens on two blockchain infrastructures.</p>
<p>Note that TFT is also available on BSC.</p>

<p>In short, there is the <a href="https://bridge.bsc.threefold.io/">BSC-Stellar Bridge</a> and the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">TF Chain-Stellar</a> Bridge.</p>
<p>The BSC-Stellar Bridge is used to go between the Stellar Chain and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
The TFChain-Stellar Bridge is used to go between Stellar Chain and TF Chain.</p>
<p>To go from BSC to TF Chain, or from TF Chain to BSC, you need to use the two bridges.</p>
<p>BSC can be used to sell/buy TFT while TF Chain can be used to deploy Dapps on https://play.grid.tf</p>

<p>In general, to set up a Stellar address to transact TFT on Stellar chain, you can use any Stellar wallet that has a TFT trustline enabled. Note that on Stellar chain, fees are paid in XLM. </p>
<p>The easiest way is to simply create an account on the Threefold Connect App (for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threefold-connect/id1459845885">iOS</a>) and to then use the TFT wallet of the app, which has by default a TFT trustline on Stellar chain and also comes with 1 XLM sponsored by Threefold for transaction fees.</p>

<p>Yes, every blockchain has an explorer function and these explorer functions allow you to see transactions and export them. TFT is on 2 chains at the moment: Stellar and Polkadot.</p>
<p>For Stellar based TFT’s there is an explorer here: https://stellar.expert/explorer/public. Enter you wallet address in the top left search box, and after pressing enter you should see every transaction related to your account.</p>
<p>If you are not deploying/doing things on the TF Grid (dev, test or mainnet) you will not have transferred any tokens to the TF Chain, therefore all your tokens/wallets will be on the Stellar Chain.</p>

name
farmID
}
}</p>
<p>This code can be written automatically if you simply select the proper parameters in the left menu.
For the previous example, we had to click on &quot;farms&quot;, then &quot;where&quot;, and then &quot;name_contains&quot;. After clicking on &quot;name_contains&quot;, you need to add the words you are looking for, in this example we had &quot;duck&quot;.

<p>A solution provider offers a solution on the Threefold Grid and receives 50% of the TFT utilization revenues from the workload related to the solution.</p>
<p>A &quot;solution&quot; is something running on the grid, created by a community member. This can be brought forward to the council, who can vote on it to recognize it as a solution. On contract creation, a recognized solution can be referenced, in which case part of the payment goes toward the address coupled to the solution.</p>
<p>To become a solution provider, read the next question.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-can-i-become-a-solution-provider-on-top-of-the-threefold-grid"><a class="header" href="#how-can-i-become-a-solution-provider-on-top-of-the-threefold-grid">How can I become a solution provider on top of the Threefold Grid?</a></h3>
<p>Threefold uses the Proof-of-Utilization distribution where 50% of the TFT utilization revenues goes to the solution provider offering a solution. If there is no solution provider associated with the deployment, the 50% revenues goes to a DAO owned Community Grant Wallet.</p>
<p>There are a few steps to follow to become a solution provider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Follow the steps detailed in this <a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/blob/development/substrate-node/pallets/pallet-smart-contract/solution_provider.md">documentation</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then write a <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/c/threefold-grid-utilization/solutions-being-created/76">Threefold Forum post</a> explaining what the solution provider does</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the two first steps are done, a DAO proposal will be launched to decide if the solution is approved</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Those two concepts are closely linked.</p>
<p>On a technical level, the solution provider and the sales channel constitute a simple mechanism whereby up to 50% of the TFT spent on a deployment can be redirected to another wallet. The object in TF Chain that makes this possible, by linking the deployment contract and the wallet to be paid, is called a “solution provider”. This on-chain concept is thus called a solution provider, but it enables both solution providers and sales channels.</p>

<ol>
<li>VM which has a virtual disk. The virtual disk is a straightforward volume on a local hard disk. Everything stored on this virtual disk is stored only on this virtual (and thus physical) disk. Delete the VM and the virtual disk and the content is gone.</li>
<li>Quantum safe storage. Quantum safe storage uses a “Storage Engine” that parts, compresses, encrypts and then mathematically describes the data.</li>

<p>No, this is not possible. The twin created in the farming section of the TF Connect app is not directly associated with the mnemonics from the Threefold Playground.</p>
<p>To generate the seed phrase, you can go to the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a>. You will be able to install the Polkadot extension, create an account within it (keep the seed phrase safe), then activate a twin for that account on the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>You will then be able to use the seed phrase to create a profile manager.</p>

<p>The following is a list of certain features related to containers as well as full and micro virtual machines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Container
<ul>
<li>generally designed to run a single application</li>
<li>doesn't need to include a full operating system</li>
<li>relies on the kernel of the host system, no hypervisor needed</li>
<li>isolated from the rest of the host system for security and can be limited in resources used</li>
<li>examples: on the <a href="https://play.grid.tf/">Playground</a>, we have <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual__weblets_k8s?id=kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual__weblets_caprover?id=caprover">Caprover</a>, which are both environments that host containers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Micro VM
<ul>
<li>a container image promoted to run as a VM by pairing with a generic kernel</li>
<li>more isolated than a container, thus more secure</li>
<li>generally lighter than a full VM</li>
<li>can be created from any Docker container image by uploading it to the <a href="faq/hub.grid.tf">Hub</a></li>
<li>examples: on the <a href="https://play.grid.tf/">Playground</a>, we have Ubuntu 20.04, Alpine-3, CentOS-8 and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full VM
<ul>
<li>contains a complete operating system including kernel</li>
<li>capable of anything that can be done with a Linux server</li>
<li>compatible with any guides and tutorials written for the same version of the distribution they are running</li>
<li>normally contains systemd, unlike containers which normally do not</li>
<li>can load kernel modules or replace the kernel entirely, so has best compatibility</li>
<li>generally heavier than micro VM</li>
<li>examples: on the <a href="https://play.grid.tf/">Playground</a>, we have Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, 22.04 and more</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can run Kubernetes on a micro VM and you can run a very minimal operating system in a full VM. There are many possibilities when using those technologies.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-3node-gateway-how-can-i-configure-a-3node-as-a-gateway-node"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-3node-gateway-how-can-i-configure-a-3node-as-a-gateway-node">What is a 3node gateway? How can I configure a 3node as a gateway node?</a></h3>
<p>A 3node becomes a gateway when a Threefold farmer adds a public IP address to the node itself on the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a>. In doing so, the IP address is then handed over to the base operating system of the node itself. The IP address can then be used in the overall functions of the TF Grid.</p>
<p>Note that this process differs from when an IP address that has been added to a farm is deployed with a workload in order for that workload to be accessible on the Internet.</p>
<p>To configure a 3node as a gateway node, you need a public IP block from your internet service provider (ISP).</p>
<p>You can configure a 3node as a gateway node on the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">TF mainnet</a>, <a href="https://dashboard.test.grid.tf/">TF testnet</a> and <a href="https://dashboard.dev.grid.tf/">TF devnet</a>. You thus need to choose the correct TF Dashboard link (main, test, dev).</p>
<p>To configure a 3node as a gateway node, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure your DNS records
<ul>
<li>Type: A
<ul>
<li>Name: &lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;</li>
<li>Value: &lt;YOUR_IPv4_ADDRESS&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type: NS
<ul>
<li>Name: _acme-challenge.&lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;</li>
<li>Value: &lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;.&lt;YOUR_DOMAIN&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type: CNAME
<ul>
<li>Name: *.&lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;.&lt;YOUR_DOMAIN&gt;</li>
<li>Value: &lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type: AAAA 
<ul>
<li>Name: &lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;</li>
<li>Value: &lt;YOUR_IPv6_ADDRESS&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configure your 3node parameters on the TF Dashboard
<ul>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a></li>
<li>Go to the section <strong>Portal</strong></li>
<li>Go to the subsection <strong>Farms</strong></li>
<li>Choose the 3node you want to turn into a gateway node and click on <strong>Actions</strong> (Add a public config) on the right</li>
<li>Enter the necessary information and click <strong>Save</strong>
<ul>
<li>IPV4: Enter the IPv4 address of your public IP block</li>
<li>Gateway: Enter the gateway of your public IP block</li>
<li>IPV6: Enter the IPv6 address of your public IP block</li>
<li>Gateway IPV6: Enter the gateway of your public IP block</li>
<li>Domain: &lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;.&lt;YOUR_DOMAIN&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this is done, you should see the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the section <strong>PUB</strong> of your 3node screen.</p>

How can I have more than one gateway assigned to a deployment? Can more gateways be added after deployment?</a></h3>
<p>As of now, gateways are a simple one-to-one HTTPS proxy, one subdomain that comes from a gateway node. A domain points to one IP address.</p>
<p>It is currently in development, but gateways will be a simple reservation (name + hashed secret).</p>
<p>Connecting to gateways is done with a client tool (user needs to run this). More gateways can be added later (and client then connects to them). Webgw will be a layer 4 (TCP) proxy, so user process needs to do TLS termination. User will also need a domain name. Domain can be configured with multiple IP’s to support multiple gateways.
Implementation itself will be functionally different from V2 gateways, but high lvl idea applies.
This means name / domain reservation as they are now will become deprecated as we no longer support TLS termination on the gateway.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-deploy-a-presearch-node"><a class="header" href="#can-i-deploy-a-presearch-node">Can I deploy a Presearch Node?</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to deploy a Presearch node on the Threefold Grid. You can easily deploy a Presearch node on the Threefold Playground. Follow <a href="https://play.grid.tf/#/presearch">this link</a>. </p>
<p>Note that each 3node can deploy one Presearch node without the need of having a public IP. To deploy more than one Presearch node on a 3node, you will need to select on the TF Grid a 3node with a Public IP.</p>

How can I get a TFT discount when I deploy a Presearch node?</a></h3>
<p>The minimum amount of TFT that needs to be in your Threefold Profile before you can deploy a Presearch node is 2 TFT. But this would not last very long. </p>
<p>To benefit from the biggest reduction in price (-60%), you need to have a sufficient amount of TFT in your wallet. The TFT is not locked and simply needs to be present in your wallet.</p>
<p>For the capacity of a Presearch node, the amount is around 5000 TFT, covering 3 years that the workload could run.</p>
<p>Note that a Presearch node requires about 3 days to stabilize.</p>

What are the main steps when deploying workloads on a dedicated node?</a></h3>
<p>In short, you first need to rent the dedicated node, then deploy on the TF Grid by selecting your dedicated node. It won’t cost anything more when you select your dedicated node.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rent a dedicated node
<ul>
<li>go to the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a> 
<ul>
<li>on the left menu: choose portal, then choose Dedicated Nodes
<ul>
<li>choose a node
<ul>
<li>rent it
<ul>
<li>take note of the node ID in the section &quot;MINE&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy workload(s) with a dedicated node
<ul>
<li>go to the <a href="https://play.grid.tf/">Threefold Playground</a>
<ul>
<li>choose a deployment
<ul>
<li>select your dedicated node ID in the filter (manual mode)
<ul>
<li>no additional TFT will be billed for the deployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you can deploy other workloads, as long as you have enough resources on the dedicated node</li>

<p>To import your Polkadot account on mainnet, use those links:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://dashboard.grid.tf/</li>
<li>https://play.grid.tf/</li>
</ul>
<p>To import your Polkadot account on testnet, use those links:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://dashboard.test.grid.tf/</li>
<li>https://play.test.grid.tf/</li>
</ul>
<p>Exporting and importing your account through the Polkadot extension will allow you to transfer any TFT associated with the account, whether it is on testnet or mainnet. </p>

How can I transfer my TFT from mainnet to testnet or vice versa?</a></h3>
<p>Yes, you can use the same seed phrase for you main and testnet accounts. They will have the same address on each chain but they are really separate accounts. It is much like using the same wallet on Ethereum and BSC for example.</p>
<p>To transfer your TFT from mainnet to testnet or vice versa, you need to send your TFT to the Stellar chain first. Let's say you want to transfer TFT from the mainnet to the testnet. Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open your mainnet profile on the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">mainnet Dashboard</a>, on the left menu, choose Portal and then Swap. Click the button Withdraw. Send your TFTs from the mainnet address to your Stellar address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open your testnet profile on the <a href="https://dashboard.test.grid.tf/">testnet Dashboard</a>, on the left menu, choose Portal and then Swap. Click the button Deposit. Send your TFTs from your Stellar address to the testnet address. You can use the QR code option to make the transfer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To go from testnet to mainnet, simply use the URLs in the opposite order.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the fees are of 1 TFT per transfer.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-recover-my-seed-phrase"><a class="header" href="#can-i-recover-my-seed-phrase">Can I recover my seed phrase?</a></h3>
<p>This answer covers the Threefold Playground, the Polkadot.js extension and the Threefold Connect App.</p>
<p>You can recover your seed phrase from the Threefold Playground if you have your profile manager password. On the Threefold Playground, click on the top right button to open up your profile manager settings. Write your password, then click &quot;Load Profiles&quot;. On the following screen, your seed phrase is under <strong>Mnemonics</strong>. Locate on the right of this line an &quot;eye&quot; button and click on it to make your seed phrase visible.</p>
<p>You can't recover the seed phrase from the Polkadot.js extension. On the Polkadot.js extension, you can only export and import private keys. In short, this allows you to move tokens but not to manage deployments through the Threefold Playground.</p>
<p>To recover your seed phrase on the Threefold Connect App, go to the Wallet section of the app and click on the encircled &quot;i&quot; button at the bottom right of the screen. Go to the Secrets subsection and click to see your Steller or TFChain secret.</p>

<p>To SSH into a 3node, find the IP address of your Threefold deployment and do the following on your local computer terminal:</p>
<ul>
<li>IPv4
<ul>
<li>ssh root@IPv4_Address_Deployment</li>

<h3 id="how-does-a-flist-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-a-flist-work">How does a FList work?</a></h3>
<p>In a flist, we separate the metadata from the data. The metadata is a description of what files are in that particular image. It's the data providing information about the app/software. Thanks to flist, the 3node doesn't need to install a complete software program in order to run properly. Only the necessary files are installed. Zero-OS can read the metadata of a container and only download and execute the necessary binaries and applications to run the workload, when it is necessary.</p>

<p>Each node has two IP adresses.</p>
<p>One is for for Zero-OS and one is for for the DMZ (demilitarized zone, sometimes referred to as a perimeter network or screened subnet). This separates public/private traffic from each other.</p>

<p><img src="faq/img/wethreepedia_validator.jpg" alt="wethreepedia_validator" /></p>
<h2 id="general-information-of-validator"><a class="header" href="#general-information-of-validator">General Information of Validator</a></h2>
<h3 id="what-are-validators"><a class="header" href="#what-are-validators">What are Validators?</a></h3>
<p>A blockchain validator participates in consensus and maintains the record of transactions. Once transactions are verified. Validators are computers that maintain the blockchain's integrity by keeping a record of the whole transaction history, from the first block to the last. </p>
<p>In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems like ThreeFold L0 and L2 validators are given rewards as long as they stake <a href="https://threefold.io/tft">ThreeFold Tokens</a> (TFT) and correctly participate in the network. This mechanism helps secure the network by imposing the need to lock up TFT in order to participate in the consensus decisions.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="why-are-validators-important-for-threefold"><a class="header" href="#why-are-validators-important-for-threefold">Why are Validators important for ThreeFold?</a></h3>
<p>Validators are an essential part of the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. They are essentially the moderators of the staking system and have the extremely important responsibility of authoring new blocks on the chain. To have the most decentralized system possible, ThreeFold needs a good number of validator nodes that can be elected. That’s the primary reason why we limited the amount of validators one person or entity can hold to 1.</p>
<p>This creates the greatest variety of staking options for the community and also protects the system by preventing the chain from being controlled by one very wealthy individual. When there are more people validating the blockchain, it significantly increases the barrier to being elected and allows for a fairer ecosystem to emerge.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="can-anyone-run-a-validator-node"><a class="header" href="#can-anyone-run-a-validator-node">Can anyone run a validator node?</a></h3>
<p>Validator nodes can be run by anyone with hardware that meets the minimum requirements (4TB of  storage, 32GB of RAM and 4 logical cores). Once the blockchain is set up on the hardware, all the verifications and voting is done on a web portal, a seamless process accessible to anyone. However, it is important to remember that if a validator fails to uphold their responsibilities, a portion of their stake will be slashed (fined), as such an event would impact the resilience and security of the network. </p>
<p>The responsibility of a validator (owner) can be summarized to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actively participating in the governance of the network the validator protects</li>
<li>Producing blocks (requires the node to be online 24/7 to sync with the latest blocks)</li>
<li>Validator owners are expected to be active members of the community and must always be up-to-date with the current state of the ecosystem, so that they can easily adapt to any changes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-are-the-rewards"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-rewards">What are the rewards?</a></h3>
<p>To justify the running costs of the node as well as to gather a suitable income from supporting the blockchain, validator nodes earn rewards, see <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/decentralization/validators/threefold__validator_l2_details">here</a> for L2 validators, and <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/decentralization/validators/threefold__validator_l0_details">here</a> for L0 validators.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-many-validator-nodes-will-there-be"><a class="header" href="#how-many-validator-nodes-will-there-be">How many validator nodes will there be?</a></h3>
<p>The amount of validators depends on type of validator.
While there is a maximum of 100 validators for L2 (ThreeFold Hub), there will be max 100 L0 validators per sidechain of TFGrid. There will be many sidechains on the TF Grid.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-l2-and-l0"><a class="header" href="#whats-the-difference-between-l2-and-l0">What’s the difference between L2 and L0?</a></h3>
<p>Our three layer blockchain approach provides for unlimited scale and security.</p>
<p>Layer 2 is the top layer of our ThreeFold ecosystem, also called ThreeFold HUB. It’s a Cosmos-based blockchain that is secured by L2 validators.</p>
<p>Layer 0 is the foundational layer of our ThreeFold ecosystem, also called ThreeFold Operators. It’s a network of validator node operators that secure the operating system layer of the ThreeFold Grid.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-are-the-rewards-for-l0-and-l2-validators"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-rewards-for-l0-and-l2-validators">What are the rewards for L0 and L2 validators?</a></h3>
<p>During the 2 first years, 5% yield will be rewarded to any staker. 10% of revenue of executors on the sidechain go to people staking L0. 5% of revenue of executors on the sidechain go to people staking L2. </p>
<p>10% will be deducted if you did delegated staking. In other words, if you do not own the validator node. This 10% is commission for the owner of the validator node.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-general-requirements"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-general-requirements">What are the general requirements?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Reliable electricity. Either the electricity is always on or the validator owner takes precautions to put his/her node in a data center or invests in a UPS.</li>
<li>Bandwidth &gt; 50Mbit/s continuous connection. The higher the bandwidth, the better the validator can participate in the network.</li>
<li>A 24/7 connection.</li>

<p>The hardware requirements to run a validator node are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>4TB of SSD Storage (good quality SSD)</li>
<li>32 GB of RAM</li>
<li>4 physical cores</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can deploy a validator node on any 3node on the Threefold Grid that satisfies those requirements.
This means that you can also run a validator node on your own 3node if the requirements are satisfied.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="can-i-run-more-than-one-validator-node"><a class="header" href="#can-i-run-more-than-one-validator-node">Can I run more than one validator node?</a></h3>

<p>Yes, for 50k TFT you can reserve a validator node for L0 Chain securing the TF Executors.
An additional 50k, which can come from anyone, will be enough to get rewards and voting power.</p>
<p>Thus, you need 50k TFT to reserver a validator, and 50k TFT to activate rewards and voting power.</p>

<p>Yes. It's one big Threefold family! A farm can have several 3nodes (Titans or DIY) and each 3node can be linked to only one farm.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-need-one-farm-for-each-3node"><a class="header" href="#do-i-need-one-farm-for-each-3node">Do I need one farm for each 3node?</a></h3>
<p>No. You only need one farm. One farm can have multiple 3nodes. When setting your farm, you will add an address for the farming rewards. All farming rewards from each 3node of your farm will be sent to this address. Note that you can choose to have more than one farm. It is up to you.</p>

<p>No, nodes only get deleted if the farm owner chooses to do so. Old &quot;nodes&quot; are really just entries in TF Chain and TF Chain does not modify or delete this data without external input.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="can-a-farm-be-erased-from-tf-grid"><a class="header" href="#can-a-farm-be-erased-from-tf-grid">Can a farm be erased from TF Grid?</a></h3>
<p>No, this is not possible. In the future, we will implement some features in order to allow the cleaning of unused farms. As of now, this is not possible. Also, an old farm does not take resources on the TF Grid, or very little. </p>

<p>By connecting a 3node to the Grid, you get Farming Rewards. If you set a public IP address for the Grid to use, you will receive additional rewards when your 3node is being utilized by users on the Grid. All rewards are paid in TFT. To know the potential rewards, use the <a href="https://simulator.grid.tf/">simulator</a>. More information on sales channel will be communicated in the future.</p>

<p>No. The farming rewards do not take into account the specific type of RAM, SSD, HDD and CPU. The farming rewards take into account the quantity of storage and compute units (e.g. TB of SSD/HDD, GB of RAM, # of virtual cores).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-is-the-farming-reward-calculation"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-farming-reward-calculation">What is the farming reward calculation?</a></h3>
<p>The general calculation is the following:</p>
<pre><code>TFT earned per month = 
CU farmed * CU farming rewards 
+ SU farmed * SU farming rewards
+ NU used * NU farming rewards
+ IPAddr used * IPAddr farming rewards

How can I do this?</a></h3>
<p>First, know that your TFT farming rewards are on the Stellar Blockchain. If you want to sell on Pancakeswap (on the Binance Chain), you will need to use the Stellar-BSC Bridge, where a 50 TFT fees is applicable. See the section <em>How to use the BSC-Stellar Bridge</em> in the <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-farming-guide-part-2/2990#how-to-use-the-bsc-stellar-bridge">Threefold Farming Guide</a> for more information on this method.</p>
<p>If you stay on Stellar blockchain, you can either swap your TFT, for example on <a href="https://stellarx.com/swap">StellarX</a>, where some XLM will be needed, or sell your TFT on an exchange using the Stellar blockchain. Currently, this can be done on <a href="https://btc-alpha.com">BTC-Alpha</a>. First, send your TFT to your exchange wallet and make sure you enter the memo correctly. Once your TFT are on the exchange, you can sell them on the market. Make sure to follow the exchange specific steps where applicable.</p>

<p>The most straightforward wallet possible when it comes to farming TFT is simply to use the wallet included with the Threefold Connect App. It is also possible to use other wallets that are connected to the Stellar Blockchain. In these cases, you will need to establish a trustline with TFT. You can also store your TFT on a Ledger or a Trezor via the Stellar Blockchain. See stellarterm.com, stellarx.com and solarwallet.io.</p>

<p>Uptime and status are two different things. As long as the 3node is powered on, its uptime does not reset. Its status changes to offline if it hasn't made an uptime report in the last two hours. Even if after more than two hours, the 3node isn't yet online, the uptime does not reset. Uptime is a function of the system being powered on.</p>

<p>Any 64-bit hardware with an Intel or AMD processor chip can run Zero-OS and become a 3node. For a complete guide on building a 3node, read the <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-farming-guide-part-1/2989">Farming Guide</a>. The following configurations provide guidelines on compatible and recommended setups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Servers, desktops and mini computers type hardware are compatible.</li>
<li>A minimum of 500 GB of SSD and a bare minimum of 2 GB of RAM is required.</li>
<li>A ratio of 1:4 between vCPU and RAM (e.g. 8vCPU and 32 GB of RAM) is recommended.</li>
<li>The recommended upper limit is 8 GB of RAM per vCPU as farming rewards do not increase beyond that ratio.</li>
<li>A wired ethernet connection is highly recommended to maximize reliability and the ability to farm TFT.</li>

<p>Any modern computer should be sufficient, especially once you upgrade the amount of RAM and storage to increase your TFT rewards. While CPU specs are not currently measured, they may be in the future. To insure your 3node provides meaningful capacity to the network, you should have at least 1000 CPU passmark per core as measured on https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_list.php</p>

How can I ensure proper relative humidity range for my 3node server farm?</a></h3>
<p>For a small farm set up, you could simply keep your normal air conditioner system and it should be fine. For large set up, you need to take into account the power consumption of your servers and turn it into BTU consumption. The quick equation to know the total BTU needed per Threefold Farm is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Server Power in kW * 3413 * Number of Servers = Total BTU</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total BTU will indicate the minimum number to look for when buying your air conditioner. For more information, read the section <em>Calculate the Minimum BTU Needed</em> in the <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-farming-guide-part-1/2989">Farming Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Look in your server's user manual to know the proper range of relative humidity your server can handle. If necessary, use an hygrometer to measure relative humidity and make sure it stays within an acceptable range for your 3nodes. </p>
<p>Depending on your geographical location and your current situation, it could be interesting to consider having a AC unit equipped with a dehumidifier. Read your servers' manual to check the proper relative humidity range and set the unit accordingly.</p>

In those cases, ventilation flow will be set depending on the air changes per hour (ACPH) needed. Note that the <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Technical%20Resources/Standards%20and%20Guidelines/Standards%20Addenda/62-2001/62-2001_Addendum-n.pdf">ASHRAE</a> recommends from 10 to 15 ACPH for a computer room.</p>

<p>This will depend on the specific server/computer you are using. You should check the server's technical guide/manual to get the proper information.</p>
<p>We will use here the Dell R720 as an example since it is a popular 3node choice. In this case, the <a href="https://downloads.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_ser_stor_net/esuprt_poweredge/poweredge-r720_reference-guide_en-us.pdf">Technical Guide</a>.</p>
<p>For the R720, between 35˚C and 40˚C (or 95˚F and 104˚F), with 5% to 85% relative humidity, you can have this &lt;10% of annual operating hours (around 36 days per year), and between 40˚C and 45˚C (or 104˚F and 113˚F), with 5 to 90% relative humidity, it’s &lt;1% of annual operating hours (around 3.6 day per year). All this considers that there is no direct sunlight.</p>
<p>From 10˚C to 35˚C (thus from 50˚F to 95˚F), it’s considered standard operating temperature. With relative humidity from 10% to 80%.</p>
<p>This can give you a good idea of the conditions a 3node can handle, but make sure you verify with your specific server's manual.</p>

<p>A 3node connects to the Threefold Grid and transfers information, whether it is in the form of compute, storage or network units (CU, SU, NU respectively). The more resources your 3nodes offer to the Grid, the more bandwidth will be needed to transfer the additional information. </p>

<p>The strict minimum for one Titan is 1 mbps of bandwidth.</p>
<p>If you want to expand your Threefold farm, you should check the following to make sure your bandwidth will be sufficient when there will be Grid utilization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>min Bandwidth per 3node (mbps) = 10 * max((Total SSD TB / 1 TB),(Total Threads / 8 Threads),(Total GB / 64 GB)) + 10 * (Total HDD TB / 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This equation means that for each TB of HDD you need 5 mbps of bandwidth, and for each TB of SSD, 8 Threads and 64GB of RAM (whichever is higher), you need 10 mbps of bandwidth. </p>
<p>This means a proper bandwidth for a Titan would be 10 mbps. As stated, 1 mbps is the strict minimum for one Titan.</p>
<p>The bandwidth needed for a given 3node is not yet set in stone and you are welcome to participate in ongoing the <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/storage-bandwidth-ratio/1389">discussion on this subject</a> on the Forum.</p>

<p>It wouldn't be possible to get farming rewards from such configuration. You need to run a 3node Zero-OS on bare metal and no virtual machine is permitted. Indeed, to farm TFT you need bare metal. Virtual Machine will not work. Furthermore, all disks of a 3node need to be wiped completely, thus no other OS can be on the 3node.</p>
<p>It would be possible to simply set Zero-OS as a VM on VMWare VM, but it wouldn't farm as stated.</p>

How can I wipe the disks of my 3node server with Linux?</a></h3>
<p>For zero out disks unix has a tool called “wipefs”. Every distribution should have it. So if you take an ISO image of any Linux distribution and boot in “Try” mode, you can then go in a terminal or shell and write the following command:</p>
<p>Wipe all the disks in the 3node:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo for i in /dev/sd*; do wipefs -a $i; done</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wipe all the nvme disks in the 3node:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo for i in /dev/nvme*; do wipefs -a $i; done</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will wipe all of the disk devices in the hardware. Make sure you have SU permissions (write &quot;sudo&quot; before the command line). If needed, do a backup of the disks information before.</p>

<p>Zero-OS will not boot properly if not all disks are wiped. All disks must be wiped. So for example, you can't have one SSD disk wiped and another one SSD with Windows OS on it. In this case, Zero-OS won't boot. You can only have one operating system (OS), Zero-OS, when running a 3node server.</p>

<p>A wiped disk has:</p>
<ul>
<li>no label</li>
<li>no partition</li>
<li>no filesystem</li>
<li>only zeroes</li>
</ul>
<p>On Linux to see if the disk is only composed of zeroes, use the command line (example with disk sda):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cmp /dev/sda /dev/zero</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is only zeroes, you should get the output:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cmp: EOF on /dev/sda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also use the command line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo pv /dev/sda | od | head</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some useful command lines for Linux to make sure there are no partitions, no labels, no filesystems and that the disks are filled with zeroes only:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo fdisk -l</p>
<p>sudo fdisk -lf</p>
<p>sudo parted -l</p>
<p>sudo parted /dev/sda 'print’</p>
<p>lsblk --f</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Warning: this is destructive. It erases the disk sda in this example. </p>

<p>Boot a Linux in Try mode and run the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo badblocks -svw -b 512 -t 0x00 /dev/sda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*In this example, the disk selected is sda. Choose the proper disk name in your current situation, e.g. sdb, sdc..).</p>
<p>This line will read and (over)write zeroes (0x00) everywhere on the disk.</p>
<p>To understand the line of code, note that 512 is the block size and that without -b BLOCKSIZE, the process would simply go slower.
0x00 represents the zero byte. </p>
<p>This will take some time, but it should reset the disk and hopefully fix any issues.</p>
<p>Note: it takes the 3node server around 1 percentage per minute for a 2TB SSD disk to accomplish the badblock operation.</p>

<p>*Note that BalenaEtcher will format and burn your bootstrap image in the same process. See next Q+A for more details.</p>
<p>Windows: This is done easily with diskpart. Here's all the coding needed (with disk X as an example, make sure you choose the correct disk): run Command Prompt as an administrator (right-click option), write <em>diskpart</em>, then in diskpart write <em>list disk</em>, choose your disk and write <em>select disk X</em>, write <em>clean</em>, write <em>create partition primary</em>, write <em>format fs=fat32</em>, then write <em>assign</em>. If for any reason, the process doesn't work, quit diskpart and redo the whole thing. This should fix any bug. Cautious with diskpart, it's destructive.</p>
<p>MAC: This is done easily with Disk Utility. Go in Disk Utility. Select your USB key, click on <em>erase</em> on the top, write a name for your USB key, then choose a format (MS-DOS (FAT) if USB key &lt; 32GB, exFAT if USB key &gt; 32GB), then click <em>erase</em>, then click <em>done</em>.</p>
<p>LINUX: In the Terminal, write <em>df</em>, find your disk (here we use sdX), write <em>sudo umount /dev/sdX</em>, write this line (with the proper FORMAT) <em>sudo mkfs.FORMAT /dev/sdX</em> [FORMAT= vfat for FAT32, ntfs for NTFS, exfat for exFAT], then finally verify the formatting by writing <em>sudo fsck /dev/sdX</em>.</p>

<p>In short, for peak optimization, aim for 100 GB SSD of storage and 8GB RAM of memory per virtual core (vcore or thread).</p>
<p>For example, a 32 threads (32 vcores) 3nodes would need 3.2 TB SSD and 256GB RAM to be optimal, reward-wise. 
That is: 32 * 100 = 3200 GB SSD = 3.2TB SSD, and 32 * 8 = 256 GB RAM total.</p>
<p>Adding more GB of RAM would not increase your TFT rewards. You would need more vcores if you want to expand.</p>

<p>TBW means Terabytes Written. TBW directly measures how much you can write cumulatively into the drive over its lifetime. For your 3node, it can be a good idea to prioritize a minimum ratio of 500 TBW per 1TB for SSD. </p>
<p>*Note that TBW is not a technical specification, but a general claim from the manufacturer. For this reason, it can also be good to check the warranty of the disk. For example, if a manufacturer offers a 5-year warranty to its product, it indicates that the company thinks its product will last a long time.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-an-uninterrupted-power-supply-ups"><a class="header" href="#do-i-need-an-uninterrupted-power-supply-ups">Do I need an uninterrupted power supply (UPS)?</a></h3>
<p>A UPS (uninterrupted power supply) is great for a 3node if your power goes on and off frequently for short periods of time. This ensures your 3node does not need to constantly reboot. If your electricity provider is very reliable, a UPS might not be needed, as the small downtime resulting from rare power outages with not exceed the DIY downtime limit*. (95% uptime, 5% downtime = 36 hours per month.)</p>
<p>*That being said, make sure to have settings such as AC Recovery Power set properly so your 3node goes back online if the power shutdowns momentarily. UPS are generally used in data center to make sure people have enough time to do a &quot;graceful&quot; shutdown of the units when power goes off. (See next question)</p>

<h3 id="are-sata-and-sas-drives-interchangeable"><a class="header" href="#are-sata-and-sas-drives-interchangeable">Are SATA and SAS drives interchangeable?</a></h3>
<p>This goes only one way. You can put a SATA drive in a SAS slot, but you can’t put a SAS drive in a SATA slot. See the <a href="faq/faq.html#what-is-the-speed-difference-between-sas-and-sata-disks">next question</a> for more information.</p>

<p>One of the big differences between SATA and SAS is the transfer speed. Using SATA disks with SAS cables, you will be limited by the SATA transfer speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sata I : 150 MB/s</li>
<li>Sata II : 300 MB/s</li>
<li>Sata III : 600 MB/s</li>
<li>SAS : 600-1500 MB/s</li>

How can you shutdown or power off a 3node server?</a></h3>
<p>There are no &quot;graceful&quot; shutdowns of 3nodes. You can shutdown a 3node from the software side. You need to shut it down manually directly on the hardware. 3nodes are self-healing and if they suddenly power down, no data or information will be lost. </p>

<p>No, this is not possible. The general philosophy with Zero-OS is: no shell, no GUI, and no remote control. In other words, anything that could potentially provide attack surface is off the table. This ensures a high security level to Zero-OS and the Threefold Grid in general. To reboot a 3node, you have to do it manually.</p>

<p>The noises from a server can be similar to the noise of a conventional pedestal fan. As a general rule, the bigger the server, the bigger the fans (which are mostly the source of sounds). Smaller fans need to spin faster to disperse as much heat as bigger fans. So, for example, 1U servers are noisier than 2U servers. Also, note that in general, tower servers are quieter than rack servers. Go for a tower server or desktop if you want a quieter 3node.</p>
<p>It has been stated that Dell servers are quieter than HP. For Dell, R710-R720 are quieter than Compellent. You can check the server's manual and see directly the noise they produce in decibels.</p>
<p>Note that servers generate <em>white noise</em>. White noise is often used for sound masking. For some, it helps them to relax and to fall asleep. A server in your bedroom, why not?</p>

<p>To reduce the noise, you can remove all the unnecessary cards in the servers as well as the HDD disks if you don't use them. Unplugging the SAS cables can also help. You can also set the fans to adjust their speed instead of being constant.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, servers were manufactured for durability and efficiency, and not for being quiet. Most servers are placed in server rooms where noise doesn't matter much.</p>

<p>In general, it is not recommended to set rack servers vertically as they were designed to be laid flat in racks. That being said, if you want to set your rack vertically, here are some general rules to follow. Do so at your own risk. </p>
<p>First, make sure the parts in the servers are well installed and that they will not fall if laid vertically. Second, and foremost, you want to make sure that there will not be any overheating. This means to make sure you don't block the front and rear of the unit, so heat can dissipate thought the vents.</p>
<p>If you want to put the rack vertically with the longest side of the rack laying upward, having the power supply units (PSUs) on the very top will ensure that heat dissipate well. </p>

<p>You need the bootstrap image device plugged in every time you reboot a 3node and it's a good practice to keep it plugged in all the time. The technical explanation is: (1) at first boot, it creates a minimum requirement on SSD which is used as cache (2) each time the system restarts it reuses this SSD piece but Zero-OS bootstrap is also needed to download the last image. Indeed, image is not stored on the machine and also no boot loader is installed.

<p>If you have more than one 3node associated with more than one farm, it is possible to put all the 3nodes under only one farm.
The following shows how to change the farm ID of your 3node.</p>
<p>For each 3node, you need to create a new USB key Zero-OS boostrap image associated with the chosen farm ID. This will ensure your 3node links to the chosen farm.
To create a new USB key Zero-OS bootstrap image, you can download the bootstrap image <a href="https://v3.bootstrap.grid.tf/">here</a> or you can clone an existing USB key bootstrap image associated with the chosen farm ID. In both case, you can use a software like <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">BalenaEtcher</a>.
Once you have the new USB key bootstrap image, plug it into the 3node and reboot the server.
After reboot, the 3node will have the same node ID as before, but it will now be associated with the chosen farm ID.</p>
<p>Note: If you want a new node ID for your 3node, you will need to wipe the main SSD of your 3node.</p>

<p>There are multiple answers to this.</p>
<p>(1) You can plug a monitor to your 3node and check directly its status. </p>
<p>(2) You can check your 3node status by using the Explorer of the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>(3) You can also use the unofficial, but highly useful <a href="https://t.me/tfnodestatusbot">Threefold Node Status Bot</a> on Telegram. </p>

<p>If you're 3node is correctly registered on the Threefold Grid but you cannot see it on the Threefold Dashboard, there can be many different ways to solve this issue.</p>
<p>One way to fix this is to go in the TF Dashboard, select <em>change the address</em> and then simply re-paste the same address, then the extension will ask you to resign. Usually this fixes the issue.</p>
<p>If the first method did not work, you can try to remove the account and add it back up on the Polkadot.js extension. Before doing so, make sure you have a back up of your seed phrase as you will need it to re-enter the account. Your 3node should then appear.</p>

<p>Yes, you can do a backup, but as of now this process must be done manually. </p>
<p>One way is to boot a Linux USB image in <em>Try</em> mode, open up the <em>File</em> folder of your disk that contains the node ID. Click on <em>+ Other Locations.</em> Then, open the folder that contains the folder <em>zos-cache</em> and open the folder <em>identityd.</em> In this folder, select the file <em>seed.txt</em> and make a copy of it in a safe place (USB key, notebook, e-mail, etc.). If the disk which contains your node ID is damaged, simply reboot the 3node with a new disk and the Zero-OS bootstrap image. Your 3node will connect to the Grid and assign a new node ID. Once this is done, reboot the 3node, but this time with the Linux USB image, go in the same folder as stated before and replace the new <em>seed.txt</em> file with the old file. Reboot your 3node with the Zero-OS bootstrap and you're done.</p>

<p>In your BIOS, go in <em>Security Settings</em> and choose <em>Last</em> for *AC Power Recovery. If you want, set a delay between 60 and 240 seconds. This will ensure your 3node does not power on and off frantically if your power flickers on and off, thus potentially damaging the unit. On other BIOS, it's <em>After Power Loss</em>, and you should choose <em>Previous State</em>.</p>
<p>*Depending on your 3node, the parameter might have a different name.</p>

<p>RAID is a technology that has brought resilience and security to the IT industry. But it has some limitations that we at ThreeFold did not want to get stuck in. We developed a different (and more efficient way to store data reliably. Please have a look <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/cloud/threefold__cloud_products?id=storage-quantum-safe-filesystem">here</a>.</p>
<p>This Quantum Safe Storage overcomes some of the shortfalls of RAID and is able to work over multiple nodes geographically spread on the TF Grid. </p>

(No RAID controller in between storage and the Grid.)</a></h3>
<p>Yes it is possible. &quot;You can use the on board storage on a server without RAID. You can <a href="https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html">re-flash</a>  the RAID card, turn on HBA/non-RAID mode, or install a different card. No need for RAID.&quot; @FLnelson It's usually easy to set servers such as a HP Proliant with the HBA mode. For Dell servers, you can either cross-flash the RAID controller with an “IT-mode-Firmware” (see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5nb09VksYw">video</a>) or get a DELL H310-controller (which has the non-RAID option). Otherwise, you can install a NVME SSD with a PCIe adaptor, and turn off the RAID controller.</p>

<p>First, let's define the term AMT. It means: Active Management Technology. Without going into too much details, it is to remotely access servers via the network at the BIOS level. Thus, you should plug the ethernet cable in the port next to AMT, and not into the AMT port. You can explore AMT properties if you want remote access to your server.</p>

<p>For the Z620 and the Z820, you need to do some variation on the video above. In the BIOS, go in File, then Replicated Setup, and select Save to Removable Storage Device. This will save a text file on your USB key. Then, in the text file, go to Headless Mode and remove the * in front of Disable and put it in front of Enable. Save the file and then go back into BIOS. Now go in File, then Replicated Setup, and select Restore from Removable Storage Device.</p>
<p>Running your 3node without the GPU can save some power consumption as well as giving you one more extra slot for other hardware.</p>

What does it mean?</a></h3>
<p>There are many potential answers to this. Perhaps the Host is offline, the service isn't running. This is usually the reason with TF Grid. It means the Grid is not responsive. In this case, try to boot the 3node later. If it persists ask TF Support.</p>
<p>There can also be other reasons. You might have connected to the wrong port. Perhaps you have configured iptables to block connections on that port. Your DNS might be improperly configured. You might have an Incorrect Network or Host Configuration. Many troubleshoots are possible.

What does it mean?</a></h3>
<p>First, let's see the main terms. Default gateway act as an access point to other networks, in this case the TF Grid, when there is a back and forth exchange of data packets.</p>
<p>While the last question implied a communication problem from the Grid, this error message usually means that the 3node has communication problem. In short, it has difficulty reaching the TF Grid. There are many ways to troubleshoot this error. First, let's give the most direct solution. Make sure you have a direct connection with your Internet Service Provider (ISP): your 3node should be connected to a router or a switcher via an ethernet cable. Wifi doesn't work. Make sure your DHCP is set correctly.</p>
<p>If the problem persists, check the default gateway of your 3node and then make sure your router can reach it. </p>
<p>*See next Q+A for more a possible solution.</p>

<p>As of now, Zero-OS sometimes has trouble with 10GB NIC card. The easiest solution to this is to connect your 3node with the 1GB NIC card. This should solve the issue. More fine tuning might be needed to get your 3node to work with a 10GB NIC card. Future Zero-OS version might solve this issue.</p>

Internet connection is lost. What can I do?</a></h3>
<p>When your 3node boots, Zero-OS marks the NIC port. This means you cannot change NIC port when your 3node is running. You can either put back the ethernet cable in the initial NIC port, or reboot the 3node. At boot, Zero-OS will marks the new NIC port as the main entry.</p>

<p>Some people tried the command *wipefs -a /dev/sd without success. (Where * is the specific disk letter.)

<p>First, try to disable the &quot;Halt On&quot; mode in BIOS. If you do not have this option, try simply enabling the Legacy Support (Dell BIOS for example). If this doesn't work, try to plug in a Dummy Plug/Headless Ghost/Display Emulator in your 3node. This will simulate a plugged monitor. This should fix the problem.</p>

Is there a problem?</a></h3>
<p>In general, you can simply ignore this error statement. This error is linked to the Nvidia binary driver. It simply means that your 3node lost connection with the graphic card (by unplugging and replugging the monitor for example).</p>

What could cause this and what could I do to resolve the issue?</a></h3>
<p>There is a possibility that this happens because you are booting your 3node on a HDD. A 3node needs a minimum of 500GB of SSD to work properly.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that you are using the correct boot option (Legacy BIOS or UEFI) in the Settings and that it corresponds to the correct booting image on the Threefold Bootstrap page.</p>
<p>This problem often arises when you plugged your disks in the wrong controller. For example, try unpluging the disks from the SAS controller, and plug them in the SATA controller. Also, disable the SAS controller if needed.</p>
<p>In a Legacy BIOS boot, make sure Legacy is enabled and disable <em>Data Execution Prevention</em> if possible.</p>
<p>Also, it might have to do with your RAID controller configuration. Make sure this is properly set. For example, configuring all the HDD disks into one logical disk can fix this problem, or re-flashing the RAID card can also help.</p>

<p>Yes, there are many ways to prevent this. An easy solution is to set the DHCP server to reserve local IPs for the 3nodes MAC addresses.</p>
<p>This problem is also preventable if your router stays online during the modem reboot. </p>
<p>Indeed, rebooting the 3nodes is necessary when there are local IP changes, as 3nodes are addressed a local IP addresses when they are booted.</p>
<p>The DHCP will addresses any local IP address that is available when you are booting a 3node. Reserving local IP addresses is a good TF farming practice.</p>

<p>First make sure your network cable is plugged in and that your DHCP is working and responding. If you change the NIC port of the ethernet cable, make sure to reboot the 3node so Zero-OS can change the NIC port attribution.</p>
<p>Some farmers reported that this got fixed by simply powering off the 3node(s), the router and modem for 2 minutes then powering it all back on. Resetting the modem and router (switch on the hardware) in the process can also help.</p>
<p>If this doesn't work, try to upgrade the firmware of the NIC and the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, the NIC card might be broken. Try with another NIC card.</p>

In Zero-OS, I get the failure message No network card found and then the 3node reebots after few seconds. The same happens for every LAN input. What can I do?</a></h3>
<p>The first thing to try here is to boot the server in BIOS mode instead of UEFI mode. If this doesn't fix the problem, try the following.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this happens when the firmwares of BIOS, iDRAC, Lifecycle Controller and NIC are incompatible to each other. The solution is then to update them all correctly. Some problems can arise in the process.</p>
<p>First, you should try to do the updates using iDRAC as you can update both iDRAC and BIOS there. If this does not work, try to update separate, with a live-linux distro, the BIOS, iDRAC and Lifecycle Controller. Once this is done, the server should be able to do a liveupdate, https to dell support website, via lifecycle-controller. This would update the other components. For more details on this method, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISA7j2BKgjI">this video</a>.</p>
<p>Note: Some farmers have reported that the Broadcom NIC card does not work well for Zero-OS and that a standard Intel PCI NIC card replacement resolved the issue. This could be a more straightforward method if updating the firmwares doesn't resolve the issue.</p>

<p>This might work, but it has been reported by farmers that Zero-OS might have difficulties booting when this is done with a VGA/HDMI adaptor on a TV screen. This is most likely due to the TV screen not supporting the output once the system loaded into Zero-OS. The easy fix to this issue is to use a standard computer monitor with a VGA plug.</p>

<p>There may be several causes to this issue. You can try to remove all the RAM sticks, to clean the dust and then to reseat the RAM sticks. If it still doesn't resolve the issue, you can check the RAM sticks one by one to see if one is malfunctioning. This often resolves the issue. Also, some cables might not be properly connected.</p>

<p>This usually means that the IPV6 attributed is not valid. It is also often caused when the DNS configuration does not resolve IPV6 correctly.</p>
<p>To fix this issue, it is often necessary to adjust the IPV6 settings related to the router and the modem. Confirming with your Internet service provider (ISP) that the IPV6 settings are properly configured could also be necessary to fix the issue.</p>

<p>Make sure you have network stack enabled in BIOS. If so, check you ethernet port and make sure that it's clean. Also make sure the ethernet rj45 connectors are clean on both ends. If that does not work, verify the state of your SATA cables. If all this doesn't work, download and re-install Zero-OS.</p>

<p>The Grid uses an algorithm that does not continually monitor the 3node. It does its best to determine uptime through occasional checking in, which we call ping. The 3node sends a ping to the Grid and the Grid sends a ping to the 3node to confirm the reception. (Ping-Pong!)</p>
<p>It’s helpful to understand that the Grid is really just 3nodes and TF Chain (which itself is a collection of nodes). Nodes report their uptime by writing an entry on TF Chain, about once every two hours. These reports are used for minting.</p>

<p>No. The only uptime you lose is the time your 3node was offline from the Threefold Grid. This Threefold Grid still has the data of your total uptime of the month.

How can I achieve dual channel configuration with sticks of RAM?</a></h3>
<p>First, always use RAM sticks of the same size and type. It should be noted on your motherboard which slots to populate first. As a general guide, there is usually 2 slots A and B, with each 2 memory stick entries. You must then install the ram sticks on A1 and B1 in order to achieve dual channel, then A2 and B2 if you have more (visual order: A1 A2 B1 B2).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: You want to start with your largest sticks, evenly distributed between both processors and work your way down to your smallest. Let's take an example with 2 processors as well as 4x 16GB sticks and 4x 8GB sticks. The arrangement would be A1-16GB, B1-16GB, A2-16GB, B2-16GB, A3-8GB, B3-8GB, A4-8GB, B4-8GB. Avoid odd numbers as well. You optimally want pairs. So if you only have 5x 8GB sticks, only install 4 until you have an even 6.</p>

<p>Be careful when installing memory on a server. Always check your server's documentation to make sure your RAM sticks combination are correct. </p>
<p>For example, on the Dell R720, you can have 24x16gb RAM ECC sticks, but it can only handle 16 Quad ranked DIMMs. In this case, you can fill up all slots with registered DIMMs if you have a maximum of 4 quad DIMMS ranked on each CPU.</p>

<p>We could do that, but as we are in the testing phase right now, it is not a good idea.

<p>Yes, that is a requirement. Nodes are powered on by other nodes (WOL packet comes from one of the nodes in the farm). So if you want to be able to power them back on you have to have at least one node powered on.</p>
