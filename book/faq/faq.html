<h3 id="what-is-the-the-threefold-blockchain"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-the-threefold-blockchain">What is the the Threefold blockchain?</a></h3>
<p>ThreeFold blockchain is the layer 0 infrastructure for an open source peer-to-peer (P2P) Internet owned by humanity.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-architecture-of-the-threefold-grid-in-simple-terms"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-architecture-of-the-threefold-grid-in-simple-terms">What is the architecture of the Threefold Grid in simple terms?</a></h3>
<p>Essentially, the Threefold Grid is composed of the people using it, the 3node servers offering compute, storage and network resources, and the TF Chain, which is the blockchain of Threefold.</p>
<p>Middleware is also used, such as GraphQL and GrixProxy, to get and organize data from the Threefold Chain.
Middleware helps to make data available and to manage load.</p>
<p>3nodes store workloads data and can report on their state to the TF Grid and to middleware.</p>

<p>ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, applications) on the ThreeFold Network – generated only when active capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.
It has a specific commercial utility, since ThreeFold Tokens were conceived as the designated currency for buying and selling capacity on the ThreeFold Grid.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-are-threefold-token-tft-produced"><a class="header" href="#how-are-threefold-token-tft-produced">How are Threefold Token (TFT) produced?</a></h3>
<p>ThreeFold Tokens are exclusively produced through a process called farming, which means that TFT are generated only when new Internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. There is no wasteful mining.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-are-the-tft-managed"><a class="header" href="#how-are-the-tft-managed">How are the TFT managed?</a></h3>
<p>TFT are managed by the ThreeFold Blockchain (“TF Chain”). </p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-internet-capacity-and-connectivity-does-threefold-replace-my-internet-service-provider-isp"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-internet-capacity-and-connectivity-does-threefold-replace-my-internet-service-provider-isp">What is the difference between Internet capacity and connectivity? Does ThreeFold replace my Internet service provider (ISP)?</a></h3>
<p>In simple terms, the Internet is composed of both capacity and connectivity. Capacity is where the data and resources are being handled, for example in servers. Connectivity is the infrastructure that transfer data and resources between servers. The latter is linked to the typical Internet service provider (ISP).</p>
<p>ThreeFold’s technology enables distributed capacity generation, but Threefold doesn’t deal in connectivity.

<p>QSFS is built from storage devices which are distributed and decentralized.</p>
<p>The storage engine is a software running on a VM that can run everywhere.
If the storage engine needs to run on a different VM the config needs to pushed to the new VM.
In short, yes Quantum safe file system (QSFS) can be recovered on a different VM. It is not automated yet on Zero-OS. A video tutorial will be shared soon.</p>

How is the Threefold Token (TFT) distributed when there is utilization on the Threefold Grid?</a></h3>
<p>Here are the general steps of the Proof-of-Utilization process:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user reserves Internet capacity on a given set of <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__3node">3Nodes</a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__zos">Zero-OS</a> records the reserved and used CU, SU, NU and IPAddresses in correlation with <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__tfchain">TFChain</a> records. </li>
<li>The TFChain <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__dao">DAO</a> will charge the costs to the user in line with <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__staking_discount_levels">discount mechanism</a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__threefold_token">TFT</a> from the user account are burned/distributed in line to table below.</li>
</ol>
<p>When people spend Threefold Tokens on the Threefold Grid for any kind of deployment, the TFT is distributed as per the Proof-of-Utilization distribution flow. </p>
<p>The Proof-of-Utilization distribution flow is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% goes to solution providers and sales channels*</li>
<li>35% goes to TFT burning</li>
<li>10% goes to the Threefold Foundation</li>
<li>5% goes to the Validator Staking Pool</li>
</ul>
<p>To see the Proof-of-Utilization distribution flow chart, check this <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tokens/threefold__token_overview">link</a>.</p>
<p>*Note: For billing purposes, ThreeFold DAO will check if the workload comes from a known sales channel and/or solution provider. If yes, then the billing smart contract code will know how to distribute the TFTs. If the sales channel and/or solution provider is not known, then the 50% will go to a DAO owned Community Grant Wallet.</p>

<p>Stellar is basically a payment network. But we also need a decentralized way to store the full infrastructure of farms, nodes, contracts, billing reports etc. This is available now on TFChain, as you can see <a href="https://graphql.grid.tf/graphql">here</a>. </p>
<p>Stellar remains very good when it's purely about fast payment, while TF Chain is used as the decentralized blockchain of the New Internet.</p>
<p>It's why both remain active, with a bridge in-between to enable transfer of the same tokens on two blockchain infrastructures.</p>
<p>Note that TFT is also available on BSC.</p>

<li>Make sure the  <em>MESSAGE</em>  is correctly entered.</li>
<li>Press  <em>Send Tokens</em>.</li>
<li>Press  <em>Confirm</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this method, you use the Bridge directly. Thus, it is normal if you do not see your standard MetaMask address. MetaMask is on ERC20 and TFT is on Stellar. You are sending TFT to the Bridge's address, and the Bridge sends money to your wallet afterward.</p>

<p>Yes, every blockchain has an explorer function and these explorer functions allow you to see transactions and export them. TFT is on 2 chains at the moment: Stellar and Polkadot.</p>
<p>For Stellar based TFT’s there is an explorer here: https://stellar.expert/explorer/public. Enter you wallet address in the top left search box, and after pressing enter you should see every transaction related to your account.</p>
<p>If you are not deploying/doing things on the TF Grid (dev, test or mainnet) you will not have transferred any tokens to the TF Chain, therefore all your tokens/wallets will be on the Stellar Chain.</p>

name
farmID
}
}</p>
<p>This code can be written automatically if you simply select the proper parameters in the left menu.
For the previous example, we had to click on &quot;farms&quot;, then &quot;where&quot;, and then &quot;name_contains&quot;. After clicking on &quot;name_contains&quot;, you need to add the words you are looking for, in this example we had &quot;duck&quot;.

<p>The goal of the Threefold Commercial Grid services project is to prove that the current state of the Threefold Grid is enough to start a commercial business. </p>
<p>The current TF technology stack is a good set of building blocks to create a service business on. While proving this by doing it we also create content that explains in steps how to use the technical building blocks and put it all together into a full fledged solution.</p>
<p>The benefits and purposes of this project are manyfold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Showcase that the grid stability and functionality is good enough to do this 
<ul>
<li>Ex: <a href="https://zonaris.com/">Zonaris</a> trailblazing this independently</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow anyone to build easily
<ul>
<li>Using created documentation and training material</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inspire the existing community </li>
<li>Start experimenting with the Grid functionality.</li>
<li>Attract non technical users who pay FIAT.</li>
<li>Use FIAT to fund and reward Community contribution

<p>A solution provider offers a solution on the Threefold Grid and receives 50% of the TFT utilization revenues from the workload related to the solution.</p>
<p>A &quot;solution&quot; is something running on the grid, created by a community member. This can be brought forward to the council, who can vote on it to recognize it as a solution. On contract creation, a recognized solution can be referenced, in which case part of the payment goes toward the address coupled to the solution.</p>
<p>To become a solution provider, read the next question.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-can-i-become-a-solution-provider-on-top-of-the-threefold-grid"><a class="header" href="#how-can-i-become-a-solution-provider-on-top-of-the-threefold-grid">How can I become a solution provider on top of the Threefold Grid?</a></h3>
<p>Threefold uses the Proof-of-Utilization distribution where 50% of the TFT utilization revenues goes to the solution provider offering a solution. If there is no solution provider associated with the deployment, the 50% revenues goes to a DAO owned Community Grant Wallet.</p>
<p>There are a few steps to follow to become a solution provider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Follow the steps detailed in this <a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/tfchain/blob/development/substrate-node/pallets/pallet-smart-contract/solution_provider.md">documentation</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then write a <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/c/threefold-grid-utilization/solutions-being-created/76">Threefold Forum post</a> explaining what the solution provider does</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the two first steps are done, a DAO proposal will be launched to decide if the solution is approved</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Those two concepts are closely linked.</p>
<p>On a technical level, the solution provider and the sales channel constitute a simple mechanism whereby up to 50% of the TFT spent on a deployment can be redirected to another wallet. The object in TF Chain that makes this possible, by linking the deployment contract and the wallet to be paid, is called a “solution provider”. This on-chain concept is thus called a solution provider, but it enables both solution providers and sales channels.</p>

<ol>
<li>VM which has a virtual disk. The virtual disk is a straightforward volume on a local hard disk. Everything stored on this virtual disk is stored only on this virtual (and thus physical) disk. Delete the VM and the virtual disk and the content is gone.</li>
<li>Quantum safe storage. Quantum safe storage uses a “Storage Engine” that parts, compresses, encrypts and then mathematically describes the data.</li>

<p>No, this is not possible. The twin created in the farming section of the TF Connect app is not directly associated with the mnemonics from the Threefold Playground.</p>
<p>To generate the seed phrase, you can go to the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a>. You will be able to install the Polkadot extension, create an account within it (keep the seed phrase safe), then activate a twin for that account on the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>You will then be able to use the seed phrase to create a profile manager.</p>

<p>The following is a list of certain features related to containers as well as full and micro virtual machines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Container
<ul>
<li>generally designed to run a single application</li>
<li>doesn't need to include a full operating system</li>
<li>relies on the kernel of the host system, no hypervisor needed</li>
<li>isolated from the rest of the host system for security and can be limited in resources used</li>
<li>examples: on the <a href="https://play.grid.tf/">Playground</a>, we have <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual__weblets_k8s?id=kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual__weblets_caprover?id=caprover">Caprover</a>, which are both environments that host containers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Micro VM
<ul>
<li>a container image promoted to run as a VM by pairing with a generic kernel</li>
<li>more isolated than a container, thus more secure</li>
<li>generally lighter than a full VM</li>
<li>can be created from any Docker container image by uploading it to the <a href="hub.grid.tf">Hub</a></li>
<li>examples: on the <a href="https://play.grid.tf/">Playground</a>, we have Ubuntu 20.04, Alpine-3, CentOS-8 and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full VM
<ul>
<li>contains a complete operating system including kernel</li>
<li>capable of anything that can be done with a Linux server</li>
<li>compatible with any guides and tutorials written for the same version of the distribution they are running</li>
<li>normally contains systemd, unlike containers which normally do not</li>
<li>can load kernel modules or replace the kernel entirely, so has best compatibility</li>
<li>generally heavier than micro VM</li>
<li>examples: on the <a href="https://play.grid.tf/">Playground</a>, we have Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, 22.04 and more</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can run Kubernetes on a micro VM and you can run a very minimal operating system in a full VM. There are many possibilities when using those technologies.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-3node-gateway-how-can-i-configure-a-3node-as-a-gateway-node"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-3node-gateway-how-can-i-configure-a-3node-as-a-gateway-node">What is a 3node gateway? How can I configure a 3node as a gateway node?</a></h3>
<p>A 3node becomes a gateway when a Threefold farmer adds a public IP address to the node itself on the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a>. In doing so, the IP address is then handed over to the base operating system of the node itself. The IP address can then be used in the overall functions of the TF Grid.</p>
<p>Note that this process differs from when an IP address that has been added to a farm is deployed with a workload in order for that workload to be accessible on the Internet.</p>
<p>To configure a 3node as a gateway node, you need a public IP block from your internet service provider (ISP).</p>
<p>You can configure a 3node as a gateway node on the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">TF mainnet</a>, <a href="https://dashboard.test.grid.tf/">TF testnet</a> and <a href="https://dashboard.dev.grid.tf/">TF devnet</a>. You thus need to choose the correct TF Dashboard link (main, test, dev).</p>
<p>To configure a 3node as a gateway node, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure your DNS records
<ul>
<li>Type: A
<ul>
<li>Name: &lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;</li>
<li>Value: &lt;YOUR_IPv4_ADDRESS&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type: NS
<ul>
<li>Name: _acme-challenge.&lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;</li>
<li>Value: &lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;.&lt;YOUR_DOMAIN&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type: CNAME
<ul>
<li>Name: *.&lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;.&lt;YOUR_DOMAIN&gt;</li>
<li>Value: &lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Type: AAAA 
<ul>
<li>Name: &lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;</li>
<li>Value: &lt;YOUR_IPv6_ADDRESS&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configure your 3node parameters on the TF Dashboard
<ul>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a></li>
<li>Go to the section <strong>Portal</strong></li>
<li>Go to the subsection <strong>Farms</strong></li>
<li>Choose the 3node you want to turn into a gateway node and click on <strong>Actions</strong> (Add a public config) on the right</li>
<li>Enter the necessary information and click <strong>Save</strong>
<ul>
<li>IPV4: Enter the IPv4 address of your public IP block</li>
<li>Gateway: Enter the gateway of your public IP block</li>
<li>IPV6: Enter the IPv6 address of your public IP block</li>
<li>Gateway IPV6: Enter the gateway of your public IP block</li>
<li>Domain: &lt;YOUR_SUBDOMAIN&gt;.&lt;YOUR_DOMAIN&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this is done, you should see the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the section <strong>PUB</strong> of your 3node screen.</p>

How can I have more than one gateway assigned to a deployment? Can more gateways be added after deployment?</a></h3>
<p>As of now, gateways are a simple one-to-one HTTPS proxy, one subdomain that comes from a gateway node. A domain points to one IP address.</p>
<p>It is currently in development, but gateways will be a simple reservation (name + hashed secret).</p>
<p>Connecting to gateways is done with a client tool (user needs to run this). More gateways can be added later (and client then connects to them). Webgw will be a layer 4 (TCP) proxy, so user process needs to do TLS termination. User will also need a domain name. Domain can be configured with multiple IP’s to support multiple gateways.
Implementation itself will be functionally different from V2 gateways, but high lvl idea applies.
This means name / domain reservation as they are now will become deprecated as we no longer support TLS termination on the gateway.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-deploy-a-presearch-node"><a class="header" href="#can-i-deploy-a-presearch-node">Can I deploy a Presearch Node?</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to deploy a Presearch node on the Threefold Grid. You can easily deploy a Presearch node on the Threefold Playground. Follow <a href="https://play.grid.tf/#/presearch">this link</a>. </p>
<p>Note that each 3node can deploy one Presearch node without the need of having a public IP. To deploy more than one Presearch node on a 3node, you will need to select on the TF Grid a 3node with a Public IP.</p>

How can I get a TFT discount when I deploy a Presearch node?</a></h3>
<p>The minimum amount of TFT that needs to be in your Threefold Profile before you can deploy a Presearch node is 2 TFT. But this would not last very long. </p>
<p>To benefit from the biggest reduction in price (-60%), you need to have a sufficient amount of TFT in your wallet. The TFT is not locked and simply needs to be present in your wallet.</p>
<p>For the capacity of a Presearch node, the amount is around 5000 TFT, covering 3 years that the workload could run.</p>
<p>Note that a Presearch node requires about 3 days to stabilize.</p>

What are the main steps when deploying workloads on a dedicated node?</a></h3>
<p>In short, you first need to rent the dedicated node, then deploy on the TF Grid by selecting your dedicated node. It won’t cost anything more when you select your dedicated node.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rent a dedicated node
<ul>
<li>go to the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a> 
<ul>
<li>on the left menu: choose portal, then choose Dedicated Nodes
<ul>
<li>choose a node
<ul>
<li>rent it
<ul>
<li>take note of the node ID in the section &quot;MINE&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy workload(s) with a dedicated node
<ul>
<li>go to the <a href="https://play.grid.tf/">Threefold Playground</a>
<ul>
<li>choose a deployment
<ul>
<li>select your dedicated node ID in the filter (manual mode)
<ul>
<li>no additional TFT will be billed for the deployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you can deploy other workloads, as long as you have enough resources on the dedicated node</li>

<p>To import your Polkadot account on mainnet, use those links:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://dashboard.grid.tf/</li>
<li>https://play.grid.tf/</li>
</ul>
<p>To import your Polkadot account on testnet, use those links:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://dashboard.test.grid.tf/</li>
<li>https://play.test.grid.tf/</li>
</ul>
<p>Exporting and importing your account through the Polkadot extension will allow you to transfer any TFT associated with the account, whether it is on testnet or mainnet. </p>

How can I transfer my TFT from mainnet to testnet or vice versa?</a></h3>
<p>Yes, you can use the same seed phrase for you main and testnet accounts. They will have the same address on each chain but they are really separate accounts. It is much like using the same wallet on Ethereum and BSC for example.</p>
<p>To transfer your TFT from mainnet to testnet or vice versa, you need to send your TFT to the Stellar chain first. Let's say you want to transfer TFT from the mainnet to the testnet. Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open your mainnet profile on the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">mainnet Dashboard</a>, on the left menu, choose Portal and then Swap. Click the button Withdraw. Send your TFTs from the mainnet address to your Stellar address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open your testnet profile on the <a href="https://dashboard.test.grid.tf/">testnet Dashboard</a>, on the left menu, choose Portal and then Swap. Click the button Deposit. Send your TFTs from your Stellar address to the testnet address. You can use the QR code option to make the transfer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To go from testnet to mainnet, simply use the URLs in the opposite order.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the fees are of 1 TFT per transfer.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-recover-my-seed-phrase"><a class="header" href="#can-i-recover-my-seed-phrase">Can I recover my seed phrase?</a></h3>
<p>This answer covers the Threefold Playground, the Polkadot.js extension and the Threefold Connect App.</p>
<p>You can recover your seed phrase from the Threefold Playground if you have your profile manager password. On the Threefold Playground, click on the top right button to open up your profile manager settings. Write your password, then click &quot;Load Profiles&quot;. On the following screen, your seed phrase is under <strong>Mnemonics</strong>. Locate on the right of this line an &quot;eye&quot; button and click on it to make your seed phrase visible.</p>
<p>You can't recover the seed phrase from the Polkadot.js extension. On the Polkadot.js extension, you can only export and import private keys. In short, this allows you to move tokens but not to manage deployments through the Threefold Playground.</p>
<p>To recover your seed phrase on the Threefold Connect App, go to the Wallet section of the app and click on the encircled &quot;i&quot; button at the bottom right of the screen. Go to the Secrets subsection and click to see your Steller or TFChain secret.</p>

Zero-OS can read the metadata of a container and only download and execute the necessary binaries and applications to run the workload, when it is necessary.</p>

<p><img src="img/wethreepedia_validator.jpg" alt="wethreepedia_validator" /></p>
<h2 id="general-information-of-validator"><a class="header" href="#general-information-of-validator">General Information of Validator</a></h2>
<h3 id="what-are-validators"><a class="header" href="#what-are-validators">What are Validators?</a></h3>
<p>A blockchain validator participates in consensus and maintains the record of transactions. Once transactions are verified. Validators are computers that maintain the blockchain's integrity by keeping a record of the whole transaction history, from the first block to the last. </p>
<p>In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems like ThreeFold L0 and L2 validators are given rewards as long as they stake <a href="https://threefold.io/tft">ThreeFold Tokens</a> (TFT) and correctly participate in the network. This mechanism helps secure the network by imposing the need to lock up TFT in order to participate in the consensus decisions.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="why-are-validators-important-for-threefold"><a class="header" href="#why-are-validators-important-for-threefold">Why are Validators important for ThreeFold?</a></h3>
<p>Validators are an essential part of the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. They are essentially the moderators of the staking system and have the extremely important responsibility of authoring new blocks on the chain. To have the most decentralized system possible, ThreeFold needs a good number of validator nodes that can be elected. That’s the primary reason why we limited the amount of validators one person or entity can hold to 1.</p>
<p>This creates the greatest variety of staking options for the community and also protects the system by preventing the chain from being controlled by one very wealthy individual. When there are more people validating the blockchain, it significantly increases the barrier to being elected and allows for a fairer ecosystem to emerge.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="can-anyone-run-a-validator-node"><a class="header" href="#can-anyone-run-a-validator-node">Can anyone run a validator node?</a></h3>
<p>Validator nodes can be run by anyone with hardware that meets the minimum requirements (4TB of  storage, 32GB of RAM and 4 logical cores). Once the blockchain is set up on the hardware, all the verifications and voting is done on a web portal, a seamless process accessible to anyone. However, it is important to remember that if a validator fails to uphold their responsibilities, a portion of their stake will be slashed (fined), as such an event would impact the resilience and security of the network. </p>
<p>The responsibility of a validator (owner) can be summarized to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actively participating in the governance of the network the validator protects</li>
<li>Producing blocks (requires the node to be online 24/7 to sync with the latest blocks)</li>
<li>Validator owners are expected to be active members of the community and must always be up-to-date with the current state of the ecosystem, so that they can easily adapt to any changes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-are-the-rewards"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-rewards">What are the rewards?</a></h3>
<p>To justify the running costs of the node as well as to gather a suitable income from supporting the blockchain, validator nodes earn rewards, see <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/decentralization/validators/threefold__validator_l2_details">here</a> for L2 validators, and <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/decentralization/validators/threefold__validator_l0_details">here</a> for L0 validators.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-many-validator-nodes-will-there-be"><a class="header" href="#how-many-validator-nodes-will-there-be">How many validator nodes will there be?</a></h3>
<p>The amount of validators depends on type of validator.
While there is a maximum of 100 validators for L2 (ThreeFold Hub), there will be max 100 L0 validators per sidechain of TFGrid. There will be many sidechains on the TF Grid.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-l2-and-l0"><a class="header" href="#whats-the-difference-between-l2-and-l0">What’s the difference between L2 and L0?</a></h3>
<p>Our three layer blockchain approach provides for unlimited scale and security.</p>
<p>Layer 2 is the top layer of our ThreeFold ecosystem, also called ThreeFold HUB. It’s a Cosmos-based blockchain that is secured by L2 validators.</p>
<p>Layer 0 is the foundational layer of our ThreeFold ecosystem, also called ThreeFold Operators. It’s a network of validator node operators that secure the operating system layer of the ThreeFold Grid.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-are-the-rewards-for-l0-and-l2-validators"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-rewards-for-l0-and-l2-validators">What are the rewards for L0 and L2 validators?</a></h3>
<p>During the 2 first years, 5% yield will be rewarded to any staker. 10% of revenue of executors on the sidechain go to people staking L0. 5% of revenue of executors on the sidechain go to people staking L2. </p>
<p>10% will be deducted if you did delegated staking. In other words, if you do not own the validator node. This 10% is commission for the owner of the validator node.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-general-requirements"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-general-requirements">What are the general requirements?</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Reliable electricity. Either the electricity is always on or the validator owner takes precautions to put his/her node in a data center or invests in a UPS.</li>
<li>Bandwidth &gt; 50Mbit/s continuous connection. The higher the bandwidth, the better the validator can participate in the network.</li>
<li>A 24/7 connection.</li>

<p>The hardware requirements to run a validator node are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>4TB of SSD Storage (good quality SSD)</li>
<li>32 GB of RAM</li>
<li>4 physical cores</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can deploy a validator node on any 3node on the Threefold Grid that satisfies those requirements.
This means that you can also run a validator node on your own 3node if the requirements are satisfied.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="can-i-run-more-than-one-validator-node"><a class="header" href="#can-i-run-more-than-one-validator-node">Can I run more than one validator node?</a></h3>

<p>Yes, for 50k TFT you can reserve a validator node for L0 Chain securing the TF Executors.
An additional 50k, which can come from anyone, will be enough to get rewards and voting power.</p>
<p>Thus, you need 50k TFT to reserver a validator, and 50k TFT to activate rewards and voting power.</p>

<p>Yes. It's one big Threefold family! A farm can have several 3nodes (Titans or DIY) and each 3node can be linked to only one farm.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="do-i-need-one-farm-for-each-3node"><a class="header" href="#do-i-need-one-farm-for-each-3node">Do I need one farm for each 3node?</a></h3>
<p>No. You only need one farm. One farm can have multiple 3nodes. When setting your farm, you will add an address for the farming rewards. All farming rewards from each 3node of your farm will be sent to this address. Note that you can choose to have more than one farm. It is up to you.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="can-a-single-farm-be-composed-of-many-3nodes"><a class="header" href="#can-a-single-farm-be-composed-of-many-3nodes">Can a single farm be composed of many 3nodes?</a></h3>
<p>Yes. You can have many 3nodes on the same farm.</p>

<p>No, nodes only get deleted if the farm owner chooses to do so. Old &quot;nodes&quot; are really just entries in TF Chain and TF Chain does not modify or delete this data without external input.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="can-a-farm-be-erased-from-tf-grid"><a class="header" href="#can-a-farm-be-erased-from-tf-grid">Can a farm be erased from TF Grid?</a></h3>
<p>No, this is not possible. In the future, we will implement some features in order to allow the cleaning of unused farms. As of now, this is not possible. Also, an old farm does not take resources on the TF Grid, or very little. </p>

Can I get more rewards when my 3node is being utilized?</a></h3>
<p>By connecting a 3node to the Grid, you get Farming Rewards. If you set a public IP address for the Grid to use, you will receive additional rewards when your 3node is being utilized by users on the Grid. All rewards are paid in TFT. To know the potential rewards, use the <a href="https://simulator.grid.tf/">simulator</a>. More information on sales channel will be communicated in the future.</p>

<p>Buy a <a href="https://marketplace.3node.global/index.php?dispatch=categories.view&amp;category_id=167">Titan</a>. This is more or less <em>plug n play</em>! You can also build a DIY 3node. It's fun and there are many resources to help you along the way.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="when-do-i-receive-my-rewards"><a class="header" href="#when-do-i-receive-my-rewards">When do I receive my rewards?</a></h3>
<p>They are distributed once a month, around the 8th*. Distributions are not daily, or after a certain threshold. Note that upcoming minting rules may have a 24 month lockup or until 30% utilization for 3 months on your 3node. </p>

<p>No. The farming rewards do not take into account the specific type of RAM, SSD, HDD and CPU. The farming rewards take into account the quantity of storage and compute units (e.g. TB of SSD/HDD, GB of RAM, # of virtual cores).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-is-the-farming-reward-calculation"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-farming-reward-calculation">What is the farming reward calculation?</a></h3>
<p>The general calculation is the following:</p>
<pre><code>TFT earned per month = 
CU farmed * CU farming rewards 
+ SU farmed * SU farming rewards
+ NU used * NU farming rewards
+ IPAddr used * IPAddr farming rewards
</code></pre>

How can I do this?</a></h3>
<p>First, know that your TFT farming rewards are on the Stellar Blockchain. If you want to sell on Pancakeswap (on the Binance Chain), you will need to use the Stellar-BSC Bridge, where a 50 TFT fees is applicable. See the section <em>How to use the BSC-Stellar Bridge</em> in the <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-farming-guide-part-2/2990#how-to-use-the-bsc-stellar-bridge">Threefold Farming Guide</a> for more information on this method.</p>
<p>If you stay on Stellar blockchain, you can either swap your TFT, for example on <a href="https://stellarx.com/swap">StellarX</a>, where some XLM will be needed, or sell your TFT on an exchange using the Stellar blockchain. Currently, this can be done on <a href="https://btc-alpha.com">BTC-Alpha</a>. First, send your TFT to your exchange wallet and make sure you enter the memo correctly. Once your TFT are on the exchange, you can sell them on the market. Make sure to follow the exchange specific steps where applicable.</p>

<p>The most straightforward wallet possible when it comes to farming TFT is simply to use the wallet included with the Threefold Connect App. It is also possible to use other wallets that are connected to the Stellar Blockchain. In these cases, you will need to establish a trustline with TFT. You can also store your TFT on a Ledger or a Trezor via the Stellar Blockchain. See stellarterm.com, stellarx.com and solarwallet.io.</p>

<p>Uptime and status are two different things. As long as the 3node is powered on, its uptime does not reset. Its status changes to offline if it hasn't made an uptime report in the last two hours. Even if after more than two hours, the 3node isn't yet online, the uptime does not reset. Uptime is a function of the system being powered on.</p>

<p>Any 64-bit hardware with an Intel or AMD processor chip can run Zero-OS and become a 3node. For a complete guide on building a 3node, read the <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-farming-guide-part-1/2989">Farming Guide</a>. The following configurations provide guidelines on compatible and recommended setups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Servers, desktops and mini computers type hardware are compatible.</li>
<li>A minimum of 500 GB of SSD and a bare minimum of 2 GB of RAM is required.</li>
<li>A ratio of 1:4 between vCPU and RAM (e.g. 8vCPU and 32 GB of RAM) is recommended.</li>
<li>The recommended upper limit is 8 GB of RAM per vCPU as farming rewards do not increase beyond that ratio.</li>
<li>A wired ethernet connection is highly recommended to maximize reliability and the ability to farm TFT.</li>

<p>Any modern computer should be sufficient, especially once you upgrade the amount of RAM and storage to increase your TFT rewards. While CPU specs are not currently measured, they may be in the future. To insure your 3node provides meaningful capacity to the network, you should have at least 1000 CPU passmark per core as measured on https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_list.php</p>

For large set up, you need to take into account the power consumption of your servers and turn it into BTU consumption. The quick equation to know the total BTU needed per Threefold Farm is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Server Power in kW * 3413 * Number of Servers = Total BTU</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total BTU will indicate the minimum number to look for when buying your air conditioner. For more information, read the section <em>Calculate the Minimum BTU Needed</em> in the <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-farming-guide-part-1/2989">Farming Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Look in your server's user manual to know the proper range of relative humidity your server can handle. If necessary, use an hygrometer to measure relative humidity and make sure it stays within an acceptable range for your 3nodes. </p>
<p>Depending on your geographical location and your current situation, it could be interesting to consider having a AC unit equipped with a dehumidifier. Read your servers' manual to check the proper relative humidity range and set the unit accordingly.</p>

<p>If deemed necessary, it is recommended to ventilate the server room in other to disperse or evacuate heat from the place. In those cases, ventilation flow will be set depending on the air changes per hour (ACPH) needed. Note that the <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Technical%20Resources/Standards%20and%20Guidelines/Standards%20Addenda/62-2001/62-2001_Addendum-n.pdf">ASHRAE</a> recommends from 10 to 15 ACPH for a computer room.</p>

<p>This will depend on the specific server/computer you are using. You should check the server's technical guide/manual to get the proper information.</p>
<p>We will use here the Dell R720 as an example since it is a popular 3node choice. In this case, the <a href="https://downloads.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_ser_stor_net/esuprt_poweredge/poweredge-r720_reference-guide_en-us.pdf">Technical Guide</a>.</p>
<p>For the R720, between 35˚C and 40˚C (or 95˚F and 104˚F), with 5% to 85% relative humidity, you can have this &lt;10% of annual operating hours (around 36 days per year), and between 40˚C and 45˚C (or 104˚F and 113˚F), with 5 to 90% relative humidity, it’s &lt;1% of annual operating hours (around 3.6 day per year). All this considers that there is no direct sunlight.</p>
<p>From 10˚C to 35˚C (thus from 50˚F to 95˚F), it’s considered standard operating temperature. With relative humidity from 10% to 80%.</p>
<p>This can give you a good idea of the conditions a 3node can handle, but make sure you verify with your specific server's manual.</p>

<p>A 3node connects to the Threefold Grid and transfers information, whether it is in the form of compute, storage or network units (CU, SU, NU respectively). The more resources your 3nodes offer to the Grid, the more bandwidth will be needed to transfer the additional information. </p>

<p>The strict minimum for one Titan is 1 mbps of bandwidth.</p>
<p>If you want to expand your Threefold farm, you should check the following to make sure your bandwidth will be sufficient when there will be Grid utilization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>min Bandwidth per 3node (mbps) = 10 * max((Total SSD TB / 1 TB),(Total Threads / 8 Threads),(Total GB / 64 GB)) + 10 * (Total HDD TB / 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This equation means that for each TB of HDD you need 5 mbps of bandwidth, and for each TB of SSD, 8 Threads and 64GB of RAM (whichever is higher), you need 10 mbps of bandwidth. </p>
<p>This means a proper bandwidth for a Titan would be 10 mbps. As stated, 1 mbps is the strict minimum for one Titan.</p>
<p>The bandwidth needed for a given 3node is not yet set in stone and you are welcome to participate in ongoing the <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/storage-bandwidth-ratio/1389">discussion on this subject</a> on the Forum.</p>

<p>It wouldn't be possible to get farming rewards from such configuration. You need to run a 3node Zero-OS on bare metal and no virtual machine is permitted. Indeed, to farm TFT you need bare metal. Virtual Machine will not work. Furthermore, all disks of a 3node need to be wiped completely, thus no other OS can be on the 3node.</p>

How can I wipe the disks of my 3node server with Linux?</a></h3>
<p>For zero out disks unix has a tool called “wipefs”. Every distribution should have it. So if you take an ISO image of any Linux distribution and boot in “Try” mode, you can then go in a terminal or shell and write the following command:</p>
<p>Wipe all the disks in the 3node:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo for i in /dev/sd*; do wipefs -a $i; done</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wipe all the nvme disks in the 3node:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo for i in /dev/nvme*; do wipefs -a $i; done</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will wipe all of the disk devices in the hardware. Make sure you have SU permissions (write &quot;sudo&quot; before the command line). If needed, do a backup of the disks information before.</p>

<p>Zero-OS will not boot properly if not all disks are wiped. All disks must be wiped. So for example, you can't have one SSD disk wiped and another one SSD with Windows OS on it. In this case, Zero-OS won't boot. You can only have one operating system (OS), Zero-OS, when running a 3node server.</p>

<p>A wiped disk has:</p>
<ul>
<li>no label</li>
<li>no partition</li>
<li>no filesystem</li>
<li>only zeroes</li>
</ul>
<p>On Linux to see if the disk is only composed of zeroes, use the command line (example with disk sda):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cmp /dev/sda /dev/zero</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is only zeroes, you should get the output:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cmp: EOF on /dev/sda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also use the command line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo pv /dev/sda | od | head</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some useful command lines for Linux to make sure there are no partitions, no labels, no filesystems and that the disks are filled with zeroes only:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo fdisk -l</p>
<p>sudo fdisk -lf</p>
<p>sudo parted -l</p>
<p>sudo parted /dev/sda 'print’</p>
<p>lsblk --f</p>

<p>Warning: this is destructive. It erases the disk sda in this example. </p>

<p>Boot a Linux in Try mode and run the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo badblocks -svw -b 512 -t 0x00 /dev/sda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*In this example, the disk selected is sda. Choose the proper disk name in your current situation, e.g. sdb, sdc..).</p>
<p>This line will read and (over)write zeroes (0x00) everywhere on the disk.</p>
<p>To understand the line of code, note that 512 is the block size and that without -b BLOCKSIZE, the process would simply go slower.
0x00 represents the zero byte. </p>
<p>This will take some time, but it should reset the disk and hopefully fix any issues.</p>
<p>Note: it takes the 3node server around 1 percentage per minute for a 2TB SSD disk to accomplish the badblock operation.</p>

<p>*Note that BalenaEtcher will format and burn your bootstrap image in the same process. See next Q+A for more details.</p>
<p>Windows: This is done easily with diskpart. Here's all the coding needed (with disk X as an example, make sure you choose the correct disk): run Command Prompt as an administrator (right-click option), write <em>diskpart</em>, then in diskpart write <em>list disk</em>, choose your disk and write <em>select disk X</em>, write <em>clean</em>, write <em>create partition primary</em>, write <em>format fs=fat32</em>, then write <em>assign</em>. If for any reason, the process doesn't work, quit diskpart and redo the whole thing. This should fix any bug. Cautious with diskpart, it's destructive.</p>
<p>MAC: This is done easily with Disk Utility. Go in Disk Utility. Select your USB key, click on <em>erase</em> on the top, write a name for your USB key, then choose a format (MS-DOS (FAT) if USB key &lt; 32GB, exFAT if USB key &gt; 32GB), then click <em>erase</em>, then click <em>done</em>.</p>
<p>LINUX: In the Terminal, write <em>df</em>, find your disk (here we use sdX), write <em>sudo umount /dev/sdX</em>, write this line (with the proper FORMAT) <em>sudo mkfs.FORMAT /dev/sdX</em> [FORMAT= vfat for FAT32, ntfs for NTFS, exfat for exFAT], then finally verify the formatting by writing <em>sudo fsck /dev/sdX</em>.</p>

What is the best optimization scenario for a 3node, in terms of Threefold tokens (TFT) farming rewards?</a></h3>
<p>In short, for peak optimization, aim for 100 GB SSD of storage and 8GB RAM of memory per virtual core (vcore or thread).</p>
<p>For example, a 32 threads (32 vcores) 3nodes would need 3.2 TB SSD and 256GB RAM to be optimal, reward-wise. 
That is: 32 * 100 = 3200 GB SSD = 3.2TB SSD, and 32 * 8 = 256 GB RAM total.</p>
<p>Adding more GB of RAM would not increase your TFT rewards. You would need more vcores if you want to expand.</p>
<p>NB: This is purely based on reward considerations. Some users might need different ratios for different specific uses of the Grid.</p>

<p>TBW means Terabytes Written. TBW directly measures how much you can write cumulatively into the drive over its lifetime. For your 3node, it can be a good idea to prioritize a minimum ratio of 500 TBW per 1TB for SSD. </p>
<p>*Note that TBW is not a technical specification, but a general claim from the manufacturer. For this reason, it can also be good to check the warranty of the disk. For example, if a manufacturer offers a 5-year warranty to its product, it indicates that the company thinks its product will last a long time.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-a-surge-protector"><a class="header" href="#do-i-need-a-surge-protector">Do I need a surge protector?</a></h3>
<p>A surge protector is highly recommended for your farm and your 3nodes. This ensures your 3nodes will not overcharge if a power surge happens. Whole-house surge protectors are also an option.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-an-uninterrupted-power-supply-ups"><a class="header" href="#do-i-need-an-uninterrupted-power-supply-ups">Do I need an uninterrupted power supply (UPS)?</a></h3>
<p>A UPS (uninterrupted power supply) is great for a 3node if your power goes on and off frequently for short periods of time. This ensures your 3node does not need to constantly reboot. If your electricity provider is very reliable, a UPS might not be needed, as the small downtime resulting from rare power outages with not exceed the DIY downtime limit*. (95% uptime, 5% downtime = 36 hours per month.)</p>
<p>*That being said, make sure to have settings such as AC Recovery Power set properly so your 3node goes back online if the power shutdowns momentarily. UPS are generally used in data center to make sure people have enough time to do a &quot;graceful&quot; shutdown of the units when power goes off. (See next question)</p>

<p>This goes only one way. You can put a SATA drive in a SAS slot, but you can’t put a SAS drive in a SATA slot. See the <a href="#what-is-the-speed-difference-between-sas-and-sata-disks">next question</a> for more information.</p>

<p>One of the big differences between SATA and SAS is the transfer speed. Using SATA disks with SAS cables, you will be limited by the SATA transfer speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sata I : 150 MB/s</li>
<li>Sata II : 300 MB/s</li>
<li>Sata III : 600 MB/s</li>
<li>SAS : 600-1500 MB/s</li>

How can you shutdown or power off a 3node server?</a></h3>
<p>There are no &quot;graceful&quot; shutdowns of 3nodes. You can shutdown a 3node from the software side. You need to shut it down manually directly on the hardware. 3nodes are self-healing and if they suddenly power down, no data or information will be lost. </p>

<p>No, this is not possible. The general philosophy with Zero-OS is: no shell, no GUI, and no remote control. In other words, anything that could potentially provide attack surface is off the table. This ensures a high security level to Zero-OS and the Threefold Grid in general. To reboot a 3node, you have to do it manually.</p>

<p>The noises from a server can be similar to the noise of a conventional pedestal fan. As a general rule, the bigger the server, the bigger the fans (which are mostly the source of sounds). Smaller fans need to spin faster to disperse as much heat as bigger fans. So, for example, 1U servers are noisier than 2U servers. Also, note that in general, tower servers are quieter than rack servers. Go for a tower server or desktop if you want a quieter 3node.</p>
<p>It has been stated that Dell servers are quieter than HP. For Dell, R710-R720 are quieter than Compellent. You can check the server's manual and see directly the noise they produce in decibels.</p>
<p>Note that servers generate <em>white noise</em>. White noise is often used for sound masking. For some, it helps them to relax and to fall asleep. A server in your bedroom, why not?</p>

<h3 id="are-there-ways-to-reduce-3node-servers-noises"><a class="header" href="#are-there-ways-to-reduce-3node-servers-noises">Are there ways to reduce 3node servers' noises?</a></h3>
<p>To reduce the noise, you can remove all the unnecessary cards in the servers as well as the HDD disks if you don't use them. Unplugging the SAS cables can also help. You can also set the fans to adjust their speed instead of being constant.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, servers were manufactured for durability and efficiency, and not for being quiet. Most servers are placed in server rooms where noise doesn't matter much.</p>

<p>In general, it is not recommended to set rack servers vertically as they were designed to be laid flat in racks. That being said, if you want to set your rack vertically, here are some general rules to follow. Do so at your own risk. </p>
<p>First, make sure the parts in the servers are well installed and that they will not fall if laid vertically. Second, and foremost, you want to make sure that there will not be any overheating. This means to make sure you don't block the front and rear of the unit, so heat can dissipate thought the vents.</p>
<p>If you want to put the rack vertically with the longest side of the rack laying upward, having the power supply units (PSUs) on the very top will ensure that heat dissipate well. </p>

<p>You need the bootstrap image device plugged in every time you reboot a 3node and it's a good practice to keep it plugged in all the time. The technical explanation is: (1) at first boot, it creates a minimum requirement on SSD which is used as cache (2) each time the system restarts it reuses this SSD piece but Zero-OS bootstrap is also needed to download the last image. Indeed, image is not stored on the machine and also no boot loader is installed.

<p>If you have more than one 3node associated with more than one farm, it is possible to put all the 3nodes under only one farm.
The following shows how to change the farm ID of your 3node.</p>
<p>For each 3node, you need to create a new USB key Zero-OS boostrap image associated with the chosen farm ID. This will ensure your 3node links to the chosen farm.
To create a new USB key Zero-OS bootstrap image, you can download the bootstrap image <a href="https://v3.bootstrap.grid.tf/">here</a> or you can clone an existing USB key bootstrap image associated with the chosen farm ID. In both case, you can use a software like <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">BalenaEtcher</a>.
Once you have the new USB key bootstrap image, plug it into the 3node and reboot the server.
After reboot, the 3node will have the same node ID as before, but it will now be associated with the chosen farm ID.</p>
<p>Note: If you want a new node ID for your 3node, you will need to wipe the main SSD of your 3node.</p>

<p>(2) You can check your 3node status by using the Explorer of the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">Threefold Dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>If you're 3node is correctly registered on the Threefold Grid but you cannot see it on the Threefold Dashboard, there can be many different ways to solve this issue.</p>
<p>One way to fix this is to go in the TF Dashboard, select <em>change the address</em> and then simply re-paste the same address, then the extension will ask you to resign. Usually this fixes the issue.</p>
<p>If the first method did not work, you can try to remove the account and add it back up on the Polkadot.js extension. Before doing so, make sure you have a back up of your seed phrase as you will need it to re-enter the account. Your 3node should then appear.</p>

<p>Yes, you can do a backup, but as of now this process must be done manually. </p>
<p>One way is to boot a Linux USB image in <em>Try</em> mode, open up the <em>File</em> folder of your disk that contains the node ID. Click on <em>+ Other Locations.</em> Then, open the folder that contains the folder <em>zos-cache</em> and open the folder <em>identityd.</em> In this folder, select the file <em>seed.txt</em> and make a copy of it in a safe place (USB key, notebook, e-mail, etc.). If the disk which contains your node ID is damaged, simply reboot the 3node with a new disk and the Zero-OS bootstrap image. Your 3node will connect to the Grid and assign a new node ID. Once this is done, reboot the 3node, but this time with the Linux USB image, go in the same folder as stated before and replace the new <em>seed.txt</em> file with the old file. Reboot your 3node with the Zero-OS bootstrap and you're done.</p>

<p>In your BIOS, go in <em>Security Settings</em> and choose <em>Last</em> for *AC Power Recovery. If you want, set a delay between 60 and 240 seconds. This will ensure your 3node does not power on and off frantically if your power flickers on and off, thus potentially damaging the unit. On other BIOS, it's <em>After Power Loss</em>, and you should choose <em>Previous State</em>.</p>

<p>RAID is a technology that has brought resilience and security to the IT industry. But it has some limitations that we at ThreeFold did not want to get stuck in. We developed a different (and more efficient way to store data reliably. Please have a look <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/cloud/threefold__cloud_products?id=storage-quantum-safe-filesystem">here</a>.</p>
<p>This Quantum Safe Storage overcomes some of the shortfalls of RAID and is able to work over multiple nodes geographically spread on the TF Grid. </p>

<p>Yes it is possible. &quot;You can use the on board storage on a server without RAID. You can <a href="https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html">re-flash</a>  the RAID card, turn on HBA/non-RAID mode, or install a different card. No need for RAID.&quot; @FLnelson It's usually easy to set servers such as a HP Proliant with the HBA mode. For Dell servers, you can either cross-flash the RAID controller with an “IT-mode-Firmware” (see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5nb09VksYw">video</a>) or get a DELL H310-controller (which has the non-RAID option). Otherwise, you can install a NVME SSD with a PCIe adaptor, and turn off the RAID controller.</p>

<p>First, let's define the term AMT. It means: Active Management Technology. Without going into too much details, it is to remotely access servers via the network at the BIOS level. Thus, you should plug the ethernet cable in the port next to AMT, and not into the AMT port. You can explore AMT properties if you want remote access to your server.</p>

<p>For the Z620 and the Z820, you need to do some variation on the video above. In the BIOS, go in File, then Replicated Setup, and select Save to Removable Storage Device. This will save a text file on your USB key. Then, in the text file, go to Headless Mode and remove the * in front of Disable and put it in front of Enable. Save the file and then go back into BIOS. Now go in File, then Replicated Setup, and select Restore from Removable Storage Device.</p>
<p>Running your 3node without the GPU can save some power consumption as well as giving you one more extra slot for other hardware.</p>

What does it mean?</a></h3>
<p>There are many potential answers to this. Perhaps the Host is offline, the service isn't running. This is usually the reason with TF Grid. It means the Grid is not responsive. In this case, try to boot the 3node later. If it persists ask TF Support.</p>
<p>There can also be other reasons. You might have connected to the wrong port. Perhaps you have configured iptables to block connections on that port. Your DNS might be improperly configured. You might have an Incorrect Network or Host Configuration. Many troubleshoots are possible.

What does it mean?</a></h3>
<p>First, let's see the main terms. Default gateway act as an access point to other networks, in this case the TF Grid, when there is a back and forth exchange of data packets.</p>
<p>While the last question implied a communication problem from the Grid, this error message usually means that the 3node has communication problem. In short, it has difficulty reaching the TF Grid. There are many ways to troubleshoot this error. First, let's give the most direct solution. Make sure you have a direct connection with your Internet Service Provider (ISP): your 3node should be connected to a router or a switcher via an ethernet cable. Wifi doesn't work. Make sure your DHCP is set correctly.</p>
<p>If the problem persists, check the default gateway of your 3node and then make sure your router can reach it. </p>
<p>*See next Q+A for more a possible solution.</p>

<p>As of now, Zero-OS sometimes has trouble with 10GB NIC card. The easiest solution to this is to connect your 3node with the 1GB NIC card. This should solve the issue. More fine tuning might be needed to get your 3node to work with a 10GB NIC card. Future Zero-OS version might solve this issue.</p>

Internet connection is lost. What can I do?</a></h3>
<p>When your 3node boots, Zero-OS marks the NIC port. This means you cannot change NIC port when your 3node is running. You can either put back the ethernet cable in the initial NIC port, or reboot the 3node. At boot, Zero-OS will marks the new NIC port as the main entry.</p>

<p>Some people tried the command *wipefs -a /dev/sd without success. (Where * is the specific disk letter.)

<p>First, try to disable the &quot;Halt On&quot; mode in BIOS. If you do not have this option, try simply enabling the Legacy Support (Dell BIOS for example). If this doesn't work, try to plug in a Dummy Plug/Headless Ghost/Display Emulator in your 3node. This will simulate a plugged monitor. This should fix the problem.</p>

What could cause this and what could I do to resolve the issue?</a></h3>
<p>There is a possibility that this happens because you are booting your 3node on a HDD. A 3node needs a minimum of 500GB of SSD to work properly.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that you are using the correct boot option (Legacy BIOS or UEFI) in the Settings and that it corresponds to the correct booting image on the Threefold Bootstrap page.</p>
<p>This problem often arises when you plugged your disks in the wrong controller. For example, try unpluging the disks from the SAS controller, and plug them in the SATA controller. Also, disable the SAS controller if needed.</p>
<p>In a Legacy BIOS boot, make sure Legacy is enabled and disable <em>Data Execution Prevention</em> if possible.</p>
<p>Also, it might have to do with your RAID controller configuration. Make sure this is properly set. For example, configuring all the HDD disks into one logical disk can fix this problem, or re-flashing the RAID card can also help.</p>

<p>Yes, there are many ways to prevent this. An easy solution is to set the DHCP server to reserve local IPs for the 3nodes MAC addresses.</p>
<p>This problem is also preventable if your router stays online during the modem reboot. </p>
<p>Indeed, rebooting the 3nodes is necessary when there are local IP changes, as 3nodes are addressed a local IP addresses when they are booted.</p>
<p>The DHCP will addresses any local IP address that is available when you are booting a 3node. Reserving local IP addresses is a good TF farming practice.</p>

<p>First make sure your network cable is plugged in and that your DHCP is working and responding. If you change the NIC port of the ethernet cable, make sure to reboot the 3node so Zero-OS can change the NIC port attribution.</p>
<p>Some farmers reported that this got fixed by simply powering off the 3node(s), the router and modem for 2 minutes then powering it all back on. Resetting the modem and router (switch on the hardware) in the process can also help.</p>

<p>Many changes to your server can lead to this message. </p>
<p>Usually, the easiest solution is to reset the disk configuration in iDRAC's configuration utility.</p>
<p>What can causes this message:</p>
<ol>
<li>During a new installation, the cables connecting to your external storage are not wired to the correct ports.</li>
<li>Your RAID adapter has failed.</li>
<li>Your SAS cables are not plugged properly or are malfunctioning.</li>

<p>The first thing to try here is to boot the server in BIOS mode instead of UEFI mode. If this doesn't fix the problem, try the following.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this happens when the firmwares of BIOS, iDRAC, Lifecycle Controller and NIC are incompatible to each other. The solution is then to update them all correctly. Some problems can arise in the process.</p>
<p>First, you should try to do the updates using iDRAC as you can update both iDRAC and BIOS there. If this does not work, try to update separate, with a live-linux distro, the BIOS, iDRAC and Lifecycle Controller. Once this is done, the server should be able to do a liveupdate, https to dell support website, via lifecycle-controller. This would update the other components. For more details on this method, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISA7j2BKgjI">this video</a>.</p>
<p>Note: Some farmers have reported that the Broadcom NIC card does not work well for Zero-OS and that a standard Intel PCI NIC card replacement resolved the issue. This could be a more straightforward method if updating the firmwares doesn't resolve the issue.</p>

<p>This might work, but it has been reported by farmers that Zero-OS might have difficulties booting when this is done with a VGA/HDMI adaptor on a TV screen. This is most likely due to the TV screen not supporting the output once the system loaded into Zero-OS. The easy fix to this issue is to use a standard computer monitor with a VGA plug.</p>

<p>There may be several causes to this issue. You can try to remove all the RAM sticks, to clean the dust and then to reseat the RAM sticks. If it still doesn't resolve the issue, you can check the RAM sticks one by one to see if one is malfunctioning. This often resolves the issue. Also, some cables might not be properly connected.</p>

<p>This usually means that the IPV6 attributed is not valid. It is also often caused when the DNS configuration does not resolve IPV6 correctly.</p>
<p>To fix this issue, it is often necessary to adjust the IPV6 settings related to the router and the modem. Confirming with your Internet service provider (ISP) that the IPV6 settings are properly configured could also be necessary to fix the issue.</p>

<p>Make sure you have network stack enabled in BIOS. If so, check you ethernet port and make sure that it's clean. Also make sure the ethernet rj45 connectors are clean on both ends. If that does not work, verify the state of your SATA cables. If all this doesn't work, download and re-install Zero-OS.</p>

<p>The Grid uses an algorithm that does not continually monitor the 3node. It does its best to determine uptime through occasional checking in, which we call ping. The 3node sends a ping to the Grid and the Grid sends a ping to the 3node to confirm the reception. (Ping-Pong!)</p>
<p>It’s helpful to understand that the Grid is really just 3nodes and TF Chain (which itself is a collection of nodes). Nodes report their uptime by writing an entry on TF Chain, about once every two hours. These reports are used for minting.</p>

<p>No. The only uptime you lose is the time your 3node was offline from the Threefold Grid. This Threefold Grid still has the data of your total uptime of the month.

How can I achieve dual channel configuration with sticks of RAM?</a></h3>
<p>First, always use RAM sticks of the same size and type. It should be noted on your motherboard which slots to populate first. As a general guide, there is usually 2 slots A and B, with each 2 memory stick entries. You must then install the ram sticks on A1 and B1 in order to achieve dual channel, then A2 and B2 if you have more (visual order: A1 A2 B1 B2).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: You want to start with your largest sticks, evenly distributed between both processors and work your way down to your smallest. Let's take an example with 2 processors as well as 4x 16GB sticks and 4x 8GB sticks. The arrangement would be A1-16GB, B1-16GB, A2-16GB, B2-16GB, A3-8GB, B3-8GB, A4-8GB, B4-8GB. Avoid odd numbers as well. You optimally want pairs. So if you only have 5x 8GB sticks, only install 4 until you have an even 6.</p>

<p>Be careful when installing memory on a server. Always check your server's documentation to make sure your RAM sticks combination are correct. </p>
<p>For example, on the Dell R720, you can have 24x16gb RAM ECC sticks, but it can only handle 16 Quad ranked DIMMs. In this case, you can fill up all slots with registered DIMMs if you have a maximum of 4 quad DIMMS ranked on each CPU.</p>

<p>We could do that, but as we are in the testing phase right now, it is not a good idea.

<p>Yes, that is a requirement. Nodes are powered on by other nodes (WOL packet comes from one of the nodes in the farm). So if you want to be able to power them back on you have to have at least one node powered on.</p>
