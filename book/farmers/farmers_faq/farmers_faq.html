<p>There are two ways to create a ThreeFold farm.</p>
<p>You can install the <a href="#is-there-a-threefold-app-for-mobile">ThreeFold Connect App</a>, set an account and then create a farm in the section Farming.</p>
<p>You can also create a ThreeFold farm on the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">ThreeFold Dashboard</a> after having created an account on the <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/extension/">Polkadot extension</a>.</p>

<p>Titan v2.1 is the hardware. Before v2.1, there was 2.0. The hardware currently being shipped is the Titan v2.1.</p>
<p>When you read v3, it refers to the ThreeFold Grid. Titans are now being sent ready for TF Grid v3 so they are being referred to as Titan v3. In short, the current Titans are v2.1 hardware ready for ThreeFold Grid v3.</p>

<p>Farming rewards are usually sent around the 8th of each month. This can vary slightly because the verification process is not yet fully automated.</p>
<p>For more information on the minting process, read the next <a href="#what-is-the-tft-minting-process-is-it-fully-automated">QnA</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-tft-minting-process-is-it-fully-automated"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-tft-minting-process-is-it-fully-automated">What is the TFT minting process? Is it fully automated?</a></h3>
<p>Minting is based on blockchain data according to strict rules that are carried out by computers with humans involved only to check for errors and to sign the resulting transactions.</p>
<p>There is a human verification mechanism through multisignatures for calculations done on the data as stored in the blockchain. This explains the timing differences when it comes to the monthly farming rewards distribution, since enough people need to sign off.</p>
<p>The detailed minting process for V3 is as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>TFChain, ThreeFold's blockchain, has all the details about capacity provided by the nodes.</li>
<li>TFChain is used to track uptime.</li>
<li>Zero-OS reports to TFChain.</li>
<li>The code in <a href="https://github.com/threefoldtech/minting_v3">this repo</a> uses the information from the blockchain to calculate the TFT to be minted.</li>
<li>A proof of what needs to be minted and why is created. This proof is then sent to our guardians.</li>
<li>The guardians need to double check the execution and the minting report. This is like a human check on the automated process.</li>
<li>The guardians need to sign. Only when consensus is achieved the minting as suggested will happen. This allows human to check the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to understant that TFChain tracks the capacity and uptime and is the source for the minting.</p>
<p>Note: Additional auditing code will be added in V4 (i.e. special code generated at runtime for verification) using security primitives on motherboards.</p>

<p>When implemented : For certified Titans 3Nodes, it is 97% uptime per month (21.6h). For DIY 3Nodes, it is 95% uptime per month (36h). For professional certified 3 nodes, it is 99.5% uptime per month (3.6h). </p>

Is there a tool to check the uptime of 3Node servers on the ThreeFold Grid?</a></h3>
<p>You can go on the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">ThreeFold Dashboard</a>, and select &quot;Farms&quot; in the Portal menu.  When you select a specific 3Node in your farm, you can see a visual graph of the 3Node's uptime of the last month. By clicking on &quot;Node Statistics&quot;, you can see past and present uptime periods.</p>
<p>To check uptime, you can also use <a href="http://publicuptime.tfcloud.us/uptimeCheck">this tool</a> made by a TF community member. This tool is also available with the Planetary Network <a href="http://uptime.tfcloud.us/uptimeCheck">here</a>. This link works when you are connected to the Planetary Network.</p>

<p>You will still need to meet the required uptime (95% for DIY, etc.3), but the period starts when you connected the 3Node for the first time, instead of the usual start of the month. This only applies the first month. Afterwards, the uptime is calculated on the whole month. *Read last Q+A</p>

<p>Terabyte (TB) and Tebibyte (TiB) are units of digital information used to measure storage capacity and data transfer rate. While terabyte is a decimal standard unit, Tebibyte is binary. </p>
<ul>
<li>1 TB = 1000^4 bytes</li>
<li>1 TiB = 1024^4 bytes. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are thus more bytes in 1 TiB than in 1 TB. 
1 TiB is equal to 1.099511627776 TB.</p>

<p>No. The farming rewards do not take into account the specific type of RAM, SSD, HDD and CPU. The farming rewards take into account the quantity of storage and compute units (e.g. TB of SSD/HDD, GB of RAM, # of virtual cores).</p>
<hr />

How can I do this?</a></h3>
<p>First, know that your TFT farming rewards are on the Stellar Blockchain. If you want to sell on Pancakeswap (on the Binance Chain), you will need to use the Stellar-BSC Bridge, where a 50 TFT fees is applicable. See the section <em>How to use the BSC-Stellar Bridge</em> in the <a href="../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#how-to-use-the-bsc-stellar-bridge">ThreeFold Farming Guide</a> for more information on this method.</p>
<p>If you stay on Stellar blockchain, you can either swap your TFT, for example on <a href="https://stellarx.com/swap">StellarX</a>, where some XLM will be needed, or sell your TFT on an exchange using the Stellar blockchain. Currently, this can be done on <a href="https://btc-alpha.com">BTC-Alpha</a>. First, send your TFT to your exchange wallet and make sure you enter the memo correctly. Once your TFT are on the exchange, you can sell them on the market. Make sure to follow the exchange specific steps where applicable.</p>

<p>The most straightforward wallet possible when it comes to farming TFT is simply to use the wallet included with the ThreeFold Connect App. It is also possible to use other wallets that are connected to the Stellar Blockchain. In these cases, you will need to establish a trustline with TFT. You can also store your TFT on a Ledger or a Trezor via the Stellar Blockchain. See stellarterm.com, stellarx.com and solarwallet.io.</p>

<p>Yes of course! In short, you will need to use a hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor/etc.) to sign in, add TFT as an asset (trustline), then send TFT to the Stellar address. For more information, read the section <a href="../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#setting-up-a-tft-trustline-on-stellar-blockchain">Setting up a TFT Trustline on Stellar Blockchain</a> from the Farming documentation.</p>

<p>Uptime and status are two different things. As long as the 3Node is powered on, its uptime does not reset. Its status changes to offline if it hasn't made an uptime report in the last two hours. Even if after more than two hours, the 3Node isn't yet online, the uptime does not reset. Uptime is a function of the system being powered on.</p>

<p>Any 64-bit hardware with an Intel or AMD processor chip can run Zero-OS and become a 3Node. For a complete guide on building a 3Node, read the <a href="../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html">Farming Guide</a>. The following configurations provide guidelines on compatible and recommended setups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Servers, desktops and mini computers type hardware are compatible.</li>
<li>A minimum of 500 GB of SSD and a bare minimum of 2 GB of RAM is required.</li>
<li>A ratio of 1:4 between vCPU and RAM (e.g. 8vCPU and 32 GB of RAM) is recommended.</li>
<li>The recommended upper limit is 8 GB of RAM per vCPU as farming rewards do not increase beyond that ratio.</li>
<li>A wired ethernet connection is highly recommended to maximize reliability and the ability to farm TFT.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any modern computer should be sufficient, especially once you upgrade the amount of RAM and storage to increase your TFT rewards. While CPU specs are not currently measured, they may be in the future. To insure your 3Node provides meaningful capacity to the network, you should have at least 1000 CPU passmark per core as measured on https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_list.php</p>

How can I ensure proper relative humidity range for my 3Node server farm?</a></h3>
<p>For a small farm set up, you could simply keep your normal air conditioner system and it should be fine. For large set up, you need to take into account the power consumption of your servers and turn it into BTU consumption. The quick equation to know the total BTU needed per ThreeFold Farm is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Server Power in kW * 3413 * Number of Servers = Total BTU</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total BTU will indicate the minimum number to look for when buying your air conditioner. For more information, read the section <a href="../TF_Farmer_Guide/TF_Complete_Farmer_Guide/farmer_guide.html#calculate-the-minimum-btu-needed-for-the-ac">Calculate the Minimum BTU Needed</a> in the Farming Guide.</p>

<p>Look in your server's user manual to know the proper range of relative humidity your server can handle. If necessary, use an hygrometer to measure relative humidity and make sure it stays within an acceptable range for your 3Nodes. </p>
<p>Depending on your geographical location and your current situation, it could be interesting to consider having a AC unit equipped with a dehumidifier. Read your servers' manual to check the proper relative humidity range and set the unit accordingly.</p>

<p>If deemed necessary, it is recommended to ventilate the server room in other to disperse or evacuate heat from the place. In those cases, ventilation flow will be set depending on the air changes per hour (ACPH) needed. Note that the <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Technical%20Resources/Standards%20and%20Guidelines/Standards%20Addenda/62-2001/62-2001_Addendum-n.pdf">ASHRAE</a> recommends from 10 to 15 ACPH for a computer room.</p>

<p>This will depend on the specific server/computer you are using. You should check the server's technical guide/manual to get the proper information.</p>
<p>We will use here the Dell R720 as an example since it is a popular 3Node choice. In this case, the <a href="https://downloads.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_ser_stor_net/esuprt_poweredge/poweredge-r720_reference-guide_en-us.pdf">Technical Guide</a>.</p>
<p>For the R720, between 35˚C and 40˚C (or 95˚F and 104˚F), with 5% to 85% relative humidity, you can have this &lt;10% of annual operating hours (around 36 days per year), and between 40˚C and 45˚C (or 104˚F and 113˚F), with 5 to 90% relative humidity, it’s &lt;1% of annual operating hours (around 3.6 day per year). All this considers that there is no direct sunlight.</p>
<p>From 10˚C to 35˚C (thus from 50˚F to 95˚F), it’s considered standard operating temperature. With relative humidity from 10% to 80%.</p>
<p>This can give you a good idea of the conditions a 3Node can handle, but make sure you verify with your specific server's manual.</p>

<p>A 3Node connects to the ThreeFold Grid and transfers information, whether it is in the form of compute, storage or network units (CU, SU, NU respectively). The more resources your 3Nodes offer to the Grid, the more bandwidth will be needed to transfer the additional information. </p>

<p>The strict minimum for one Titan is 1 mbps of bandwidth.</p>
<p>If you want to expand your ThreeFold farm, you should check the following to make sure your bandwidth will be sufficient when there will be Grid utilization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>min Bandwidth per 3Node (mbps) = 10 * max((Total SSD TB / 1 TB),(Total Threads / 8 Threads),(Total GB / 64 GB)) + 10 * (Total HDD TB / 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This equation means that for each TB of HDD you need 5 mbps of bandwidth, and for each TB of SSD, 8 Threads and 64GB of RAM (whichever is higher), you need 10 mbps of bandwidth. </p>
<p>This means a proper bandwidth for a Titan would be 10 mbps. As stated, 1 mbps is the strict minimum for one Titan.</p>
<p>The bandwidth needed for a given 3Node is not yet set in stone and you are welcome to participate in ongoing the <a href="https://forum.threefold.io/t/storage-bandwidth-ratio/1389">discussion on this subject</a> on the Forum.</p>

<p>It wouldn't be possible to get farming rewards from such configuration. You need to run a 3Node Zero-OS on bare metal and no virtual machine is permitted. Indeed, to farm TFT you need bare metal. Virtual Machine will not work. Furthermore, all disks of a 3Node need to be wiped completely, thus no other OS can be on the 3Node.</p>

<p>For zero out disks unix has a tool called “wipefs”. Every distribution should have it. So if you take an ISO image of any Linux distribution and boot in “Try” mode, you can then go in a terminal or shell and write the following command:</p>
<p>Wipe all the disks in the 3Node:</p>
<pre><code>sudo for i in /dev/sd*; do wipefs -a $i; done
</code></pre>
<p>Wipe all the nvme disks in the 3Node:</p>
<pre><code>sudo for i in /dev/nvme*; do wipefs -a $i; done
</code></pre>
<p>This will wipe all of the disk devices in the hardware. Make sure you have SU permissions (write &quot;sudo&quot; before the command line). If needed, do a backup of the disks information before.</p>

<p>Zero-OS will not boot properly if not all disks are wiped. All disks must be wiped. So for example, you can't have one SSD disk wiped and another one SSD with Windows OS on it. In this case, Zero-OS won't boot. You can only have one operating system (OS), Zero-OS, when running a 3Node server.</p>

<p>A wiped disk has:</p>
<ul>
<li>no label</li>
<li>no partition</li>
<li>no filesystem</li>
<li>only zeroes</li>
</ul>
<p>On Linux to see if the disk is only composed of zeroes, use the command line (example with disk sda):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cmp /dev/sda /dev/zero</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is only zeroes, you should get the output:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cmp: EOF on /dev/sda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also use the command line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo pv /dev/sda | od | head</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some useful command lines for Linux to make sure there are no partitions, no labels, no filesystems and that the disks are filled with zeroes only:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo fdisk -l</p>
<p>sudo fdisk -lf</p>
<p>sudo parted -l</p>
<p>sudo parted /dev/sda 'print’</p>

<p>*In this example, the disk selected is sda. Choose the proper disk name in your current situation, e.g. sdb, sdc..).</p>
<p>This line will read and (over)write zeroes (0x00) everywhere on the disk.</p>
<p>To understand the line of code, note that 512 is the block size and that without -b BLOCKSIZE, the process would simply go slower.
0x00 represents the zero byte. </p>

<p>*Note that BalenaEtcher will format and burn your bootstrap image in the same process. See next Q+A for more details.</p>
<p>Windows: This is done easily with diskpart. Here's all the coding needed (with disk X as an example, make sure you choose the correct disk): run Command Prompt as an administrator (right-click option), write <em>diskpart</em>, then in diskpart write <em>list disk</em>, choose your disk and write <em>select disk X</em>, write <em>clean</em>, write <em>create partition primary</em>, write <em>format fs=fat32</em>, then write <em>assign</em>. If for any reason, the process doesn't work, quit diskpart and redo the whole thing. This should fix any bug. Cautious with diskpart, it's destructive.</p>
<p>MAC: This is done easily with Disk Utility. Go in Disk Utility. Select your USB key, click on <em>erase</em> on the top, write a name for your USB key, then choose a format (MS-DOS (FAT) if USB key &lt; 32GB, exFAT if USB key &gt; 32GB), then click <em>erase</em>, then click <em>done</em>.</p>
<p>LINUX: In the Terminal, write <em>df</em>, find your disk (here we use sdX), write <em>sudo umount /dev/sdX</em>, write this line (with the proper FORMAT) <em>sudo mkfs.FORMAT /dev/sdX</em> [FORMAT= vfat for FAT32, ntfs for NTFS, exfat for exFAT], then finally verify the formatting by writing <em>sudo fsck /dev/sdX</em>.</p>

<p>It depends on your 3Node's system. Newer computers and servers will accept UEFI. If it does not work with UEFI, please try with the options ISO (BIOS CD/DVD) or USB (BIOS image) on the <a href="https://bootstrap.grid.tf">ThreeFold bootstrap website</a>.

<p>Plug the USB key containing the Zero-OS bootstrap image with your farm ID then power on your 3Node. If the BIOS/UEFI is set correctly and the disks are all wiped, it should boot correctly the first time. If you have any problem booting your 3Node, read the section <a href="#troubleshooting-and-error-messages">Troubleshooting and Error Messages</a> of the FAQ.</p>

What can I do?</a></h3>
<p>The first time you boot a 3Node, it will be written: “This node is not registered (farmer *: NameOfFarm). This is normal. The Grid will create a node ID and you will be able to see it on screen. This can take a couple of minutes. </p>
<p>If after some time (couple hours), the 3Node doesn't get registered, there might be something off with the Grid connection. You can then try to reboot the 3Node, or wait and boot it later. If it persists, you can check the rest of the Troubleshooting section of the Farmer FAQ, or ask around the ThreeFold Telegram Farmer chat or the ThreeFold chat for help.</p>

<p>This probably means that you either haven't connected a SSD or that you need to wipe your SSD disk(s). Zero-OS runs on bare metal and needs a minimum of one SSD disk (min 500GB &amp; 50 GB per CU). You will see &quot;cache disk : OK&quot; when it works.</p>

What is the difference between the farm ID and the node ID?</a></h3>
<p>A farm is a composition of one or many 3Nodes. A 3Node is a computer connected to the ThreeFold Grid. Each farm has its farm ID and each 3Node has its node ID.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-can-i-know-how-many-gb-of-ssd-and-ram-do-i-need"><a class="header" href="#how-can-i-know-how-many-gb-of-ssd-and-ram-do-i-need">How can I know how many GB of SSD and RAM do I need?</a></h3>
<p>You need 50 GB of SSD per compute units (CU) and a minimum of 500 GB SSD and 2 GB of RAM per 3Node.</p>
<p>A 3Node has, in general, 2 compute units (CU) per thread. Thus, for peak optimisation, you need 100 GB SSD and 8GB RAM per thread.</p>

What is the best optimization scenario for a 3Node, in terms of ThreeFold tokens (TFT) farming rewards?</a></h3>
<p>In short, for peak optimization, aim for 100 GB SSD of storage and 8GB RAM of memory per virtual core (vcore or thread).</p>
<p>For example, a 32 threads (32 vcores) 3Nodes would need 3.2 TB SSD and 256GB RAM to be optimal, reward-wise. 
That is: 32 * 100 = 3200 GB SSD = 3.2TB SSD, and 32 * 8 = 256 GB RAM total.</p>
<p>Adding more GB of RAM would not increase your TFT rewards. You would need more vcores if you want to expand.</p>
<p>NB: This is purely based on reward considerations. Some users might need different ratios for different specific uses of the Grid.</p>

<p>TBW means Terabytes Written. TBW directly measures how much you can write cumulatively into the drive over its lifetime. For your 3Node, it can be a good idea to prioritize a minimum ratio of 500 TBW per 1TB for SSD. </p>
<p>*Note that TBW is not a technical specification, but a general claim from the manufacturer. For this reason, it can also be good to check the warranty of the disk. For example, if a manufacturer offers a 5-year warranty to its product, it indicates that the company thinks its product will last a long time.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-an-uninterrupted-power-supply-ups"><a class="header" href="#do-i-need-an-uninterrupted-power-supply-ups">Do I need an uninterrupted power supply (UPS)?</a></h3>
<p>A UPS (uninterrupted power supply) is great for a 3Node if your power goes on and off frequently for short periods of time. This ensures your 3Node does not need to constantly reboot. If your electricity provider is very reliable, a UPS might not be needed, as the small downtime resulting from rare power outages with not exceed the DIY downtime limit*. (95% uptime, 5% downtime = 36 hours per month.)</p>
<p>*That being said, make sure to have settings such as AC Recovery Power set properly so your 3Node goes back online if the power shutdowns momentarily. UPS are generally used in data center to make sure people have enough time to do a &quot;graceful&quot; shutdown of the units when power goes off. (See next question)</p>

<h3 id="are-sata-and-sas-drives-interchangeable"><a class="header" href="#are-sata-and-sas-drives-interchangeable">Are SATA and SAS drives interchangeable?</a></h3>
<p>This goes only one way. You can put a SATA drive in a SAS slot, but you can’t put a SAS drive in a SATA slot. See the <a href="#what-is-the-speed-difference-between-sas-and-sata-disks">next question</a> for more information.</p>

<p>One of the big differences between SATA and SAS is the transfer speed. Using SATA disks with SAS cables, you will be limited by the SATA transfer speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sata I : 150 MB/s</li>
<li>Sata II : 300 MB/s</li>
<li>Sata III : 600 MB/s</li>
<li>SAS : 600-1500 MB/s</li>

How can you shutdown or power off a 3Node server?</a></h3>
<p>There are no &quot;graceful&quot; shutdowns of 3Nodes. You can shutdown a 3Node from the software side. You need to shut it down manually directly on the hardware. 3Nodes are self-healing and if they suddenly power down, no data or information will be lost. </p>

<p>No, this is not possible. The general philosophy with Zero-OS is: no shell, no GUI, and no remote control. In other words, anything that could potentially provide attack surface is off the table. This ensures a high security level to Zero-OS and the ThreeFold Grid in general. To reboot a 3Node, you have to do it manually.</p>

<p>The noises from a server can be similar to the noise of a conventional pedestal fan. As a general rule, the bigger the server, the bigger the fans (which are mostly the source of sounds). Smaller fans need to spin faster to disperse as much heat as bigger fans. So, for example, 1U servers are noisier than 2U servers. Also, note that in general, tower servers are quieter than rack servers. Go for a tower server or desktop if you want a quieter 3Node.</p>
<p>It has been stated that Dell servers are quieter than HP. For Dell, R710-R720 are quieter than Compellent. You can check the server's manual and see directly the noise they produce in decibels.</p>
<p>Note that servers generate <em>white noise</em>. White noise is often used for sound masking. For some, it helps them to relax and to fall asleep. A server in your bedroom, why not?</p>

<h3 id="are-there-ways-to-reduce-3node-servers-noises"><a class="header" href="#are-there-ways-to-reduce-3node-servers-noises">Are there ways to reduce 3Node servers' noises?</a></h3>
<p>To reduce the noise, you can remove all the unnecessary cards in the servers as well as the HDD disks if you don't use them. Unplugging the SAS cables can also help. You can also set the fans to adjust their speed instead of being constant.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, servers were manufactured for durability and efficiency, and not for being quiet. Most servers are placed in server rooms where noise doesn't matter much.</p>

<p>In general, it is not recommended to set rack servers vertically as they were designed to be laid flat in racks. That being said, if you want to set your rack vertically, here are some general rules to follow. Do so at your own risk. </p>
<p>First, make sure the parts in the servers are well installed and that they will not fall if laid vertically. Second, and foremost, you want to make sure that there will not be any overheating. This means to make sure you don't block the front and rear of the unit, so heat can dissipate thought the vents.</p>
<p>If you want to put the rack vertically with the longest side of the rack laying upward, having the power supply units (PSUs) on the very top will ensure that heat dissipate well. </p>

<p>It is advised to keep the bootstrap image plugged in your 3Node. Once your node has been booted with Zero-OS via the USB key, you can remove the USB key, but if something happens and the node needs to reconnect with the network, it won’t be able to do so. We advise people to let the USB key always in so the node can reconnect with the network if needed.</p>
<p>You need the bootstrap image device plugged in every time you reboot a 3Node and it's a good practice to keep it plugged in all the time. The technical explanation is: (1) at first boot, it creates a minimum requirement on SSD which is used as cache (2) each time the system restarts it reuses this SSD piece but Zero-OS bootstrap is also needed to download the last image. Indeed, image is not stored on the machine and also no boot loader is installed.</p>

<p>If you have more than one 3Node associated with more than one farm, it is possible to put all the 3Nodes under only one farm.
The following shows how to change the farm ID of your 3Node.</p>
<p>For each 3Node, you need to create a new USB key Zero-OS boostrap image associated with the chosen farm ID. This will ensure your 3Node links to the chosen farm.
To create a new USB key Zero-OS bootstrap image, you can download the bootstrap image <a href="https://v3.bootstrap.grid.tf/">here</a> or you can clone an existing USB key bootstrap image associated with the chosen farm ID. In both case, you can use a software like <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">BalenaEtcher</a>.
Once you have the new USB key bootstrap image, plug it into the 3Node and reboot the server.
After reboot, the 3Node will have the same node ID as before, but it will now be associated with the chosen farm ID.</p>
<p>Note: If you want a new node ID for your 3Node, you will need to wipe the main SSD of your 3Node.</p>

<p>(1) You can plug a monitor to your 3Node and check directly its status. </p>
<p>(2) You can check your 3Node status by using the Explorer of the <a href="https://dashboard.grid.tf/">ThreeFold Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>(3) You can also use the unofficial, but highly useful <a href="https://t.me/tfnodestatusbot">ThreeFold Node Status Bot</a> on Telegram. </p>

<p>The Explorer refetches information every 2 hours. You can wait 2 hours and see if the problem persists. Then/or, you could reboot the 3Node and see if the Explorer sees it as online. </p>

<p>If you're 3Node is correctly registered on the ThreeFold Grid but you cannot see it on the ThreeFold Dashboard, there can be many different ways to solve this issue.</p>
<p>One way to fix this is to go in the TF Dashboard, select <em>change the address</em> and then simply re-paste the same address, then the extension will ask you to resign. Usually this fixes the issue.</p>
<p>If the first method did not work, you can try to remove the account and add it back up on the Polkadot.js extension. Before doing so, make sure you have a back up of your seed phrase as you will need it to re-enter the account. Your 3Node should then appear.</p>

<p>Downgrades are counted in the current minting cycle. So you mint for the entire cycle at the downgraded specs.</p>
<p>Minting only considers a single configuration per node per cycle, and that is the minimum configuration seen at any point during the cycle. With this logic in mind, upgrades will only be recognized at the next minting cycle. Note that your 3Node will have a new ID and new price entry if you changed the SSD containing the 3Node ID.</p>

<p>Yes, you can do a backup, but as of now this process must be done manually. </p>
<p>One way is to boot a Linux USB image in <em>Try</em> mode, open up the <em>File</em> folder of your disk that contains the node ID. Click on <em>+ Other Locations.</em> Then, open the folder that contains the folder <em>zos-cache</em> and open the folder <em>identityd.</em> In this folder, select the file <em>seed.txt</em> and make a copy of it in a safe place (USB key, notebook, e-mail, etc.). If the disk which contains your node ID is damaged, simply reboot the 3Node with a new disk and the Zero-OS bootstrap image. Your 3Node will connect to the Grid and assign a new node ID. Once this is done, reboot the 3Node, but this time with the Linux USB image, go in the same folder as stated before and replace the new <em>seed.txt</em> file with the old file. Reboot your 3Node with the Zero-OS bootstrap and you're done.</p>

Is there a better way to proceed?</a></h3>
<p>In your BIOS, go in <em>Security Settings</em> and choose <em>Last</em> for <em>AC Power Recovery</em>. If you want, set a delay between 60 and 240 seconds. This will ensure your 3Node does not power on and off frantically if your power flickers on and off, thus potentially damaging the unit. On other BIOS, it's <em>After Power Loss</em>, and you should choose <em>Previous State</em>.</p>
<p>*Depending on your 3Node, the parameter might have a different name.</p>

<p>You don't need to if you use a removable media (e.g. USB key) as a booting image. It is needed only if you boot from a PXE server on your network. You should keep this feature disabled. Enable it only if you know 100% what you are doing. Otherwise it might bring vulnerabilities in terms of network security.</p>

<p>RAID is a technology that has brought resilience and security to the IT industry. But it has some limitations that we at ThreeFold did not want to get stuck in.

<p>Yes it is possible. &quot;You can use the on board storage on a server without RAID. You can <a href="https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html">re-flash</a>  the RAID card, turn on HBA/non-RAID mode, or install a different card. No need for RAID.&quot; @FLnelson It's usually easy to set servers such as a HP Proliant with the HBA mode. For Dell servers, you can either cross-flash the RAID controller with an “IT-mode-Firmware” (see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5nb09VksYw">video</a>) or get a DELL H310-controller (which has the non-RAID option). Otherwise, you can install a NVME SSD with a PCIe adaptor, and turn off the RAID controller.</p>

<p>First, let's define the term AMT. It means: Active Management Technology. Without going into too much details, it is to remotely access servers via the network at the BIOS level. Thus, you should plug the ethernet cable in the port next to AMT, and not into the AMT port. You can explore AMT properties if you want remote access to your server.</p>

<p>For the Z620 and the Z820, you need to do some variation on the video above. In the BIOS, go in File, then Replicated Setup, and select Save to Removable Storage Device. This will save a text file on your USB key. Then, in the text file, go to Headless Mode and remove the * in front of Disable and put it in front of Enable. Save the file and then go back into BIOS. Now go in File, then Replicated Setup, and select Restore from Removable Storage Device.</p>
<p>Running your 3Node without the GPU can save some power consumption as well as giving you one more extra slot for other hardware.</p>

<p>There are many potential answers to this. Perhaps the Host is offline, the service isn't running. This is usually the reason with TF Grid. It means the Grid is not responsive. In this case, try to boot the 3Node later. If it persists ask TF Support.</p>
<p>There can also be other reasons. You might have connected to the wrong port. Perhaps you have configured iptables to block connections on that port. Your DNS might be improperly configured.

What does it mean?</a></h3>
<p>First, let's see the main terms. Default gateway act as an access point to other networks, in this case the TF Grid, when there is a back and forth exchange of data packets.</p>
<p>While the last question implied a communication problem from the Grid, this error message usually means that the 3Node has communication problem. In short, it has difficulty reaching the TF Grid. There are many ways to troubleshoot this error. First, let's give the most direct solution. Make sure you have a direct connection with your Internet Service Provider (ISP): your 3Node should be connected to a router or a switcher via an ethernet cable. Wifi doesn't work. Make sure your DHCP is set correctly.</p>
<p>If the problem persists, check the default gateway of your 3Node and then make sure your router can reach it. </p>
<p>*See next Q+A for more a possible solution.</p>

<p>As of now, Zero-OS sometimes has trouble with 10GB NIC card. The easiest solution to this is to connect your 3Node with the 1GB NIC card. This should solve the issue. More fine tuning might be needed to get your 3Node to work with a 10GB NIC card. Future Zero-OS version might solve this issue.</p>

<p>First, try to disable the &quot;Halt On&quot; mode in BIOS. If you do not have this option, try simply enabling the Legacy Support (Dell BIOS for example). If this doesn't work, try to plug in a Dummy Plug/Headless Ghost/Display Emulator in your 3Node. This will simulate a plugged monitor. This should fix the problem.</p>

What could cause this and what could I do to resolve the issue?</a></h3>
<p>There is a possibility that this happens because you are booting your 3Node on a HDD. A 3Node needs a minimum of 500GB of SSD to work properly.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that you are using the correct boot option (Legacy BIOS or UEFI) in the Settings and that it corresponds to the correct booting image on the ThreeFold Bootstrap page.</p>
<p>This problem often arises when you plugged your disks in the wrong controller. For example, try unpluging the disks from the SAS controller, and plug them in the SATA controller. Also, disable the SAS controller if needed.</p>
<p>In a Legacy BIOS boot, make sure Legacy is enabled and disable <em>Data Execution Prevention</em> if possible.</p>
<p>Also, it might have to do with your RAID controller configuration. Make sure this is properly set. For example, configuring all the HDD disks into one logical disk can fix this problem, or re-flashing the RAID card can also help.</p>

<p>Yes, there are many ways to prevent this. An easy solution is to set the DHCP server to reserve local IPs for the 3Nodes MAC addresses.</p>
<p>This problem is also preventable if your router stays online during the modem reboot. </p>
<p>Indeed, rebooting the 3Nodes is necessary when there are local IP changes, as 3Nodes are addressed a local IP addresses when they are booted.</p>
<p>The DHCP will addresses any local IP address that is available when you are booting a 3Node. Reserving local IP addresses is a good TF farming practice.</p>

<p>First make sure your network cable is plugged in and that your DHCP is working and responding. If you change the NIC port of the ethernet cable, make sure to reboot the 3Node so Zero-OS can change the NIC port attribution.</p>
<p>Some farmers reported that this got fixed by simply powering off the 3Node(s), the router and modem for 2 minutes then powering it all back on. Resetting the modem and router (switch on the hardware) in the process can also help.</p>
<p>If this doesn't work, try to upgrade the firmware of the NIC and the motherboard. If this still doesn't work, the NIC card might be broken. Try with another NIC card.</p>

<p>The first thing to try here is to boot the server in BIOS mode instead of UEFI mode. If this doesn't fix the problem, try the following.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this happens when the firmwares of BIOS, iDRAC, Lifecycle Controller and NIC are incompatible to each other. The solution is then to update them all correctly. Some problems can arise in the process.</p>
<p>First, you should try to do the updates using iDRAC as you can update both iDRAC and BIOS there. If this does not work, try to update separate, with a live-linux distro, the BIOS, iDRAC and Lifecycle Controller. Once this is done, the server should be able to do a liveupdate, https to dell support website, via lifecycle-controller. This would update the other components. For more details on this method, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISA7j2BKgjI">this video</a>.</p>
<p>Note: Some farmers have reported that the Broadcom NIC card does not work well for Zero-OS and that a standard Intel PCI NIC card replacement resolved the issue. This could be a more straightforward method if updating the firmwares doesn't resolve the issue.</p>

<p>This might work, but it has been reported by farmers that Zero-OS might have difficulties booting when this is done with a VGA/HDMI adaptor on a TV screen. This is most likely due to the TV screen not supporting the output once the system loaded into Zero-OS. The easy fix to this issue is to use a standard computer monitor with a VGA plug.</p>

<p>To be sure, look into the owner's manual of your specific computer.</p>
<p>In general, you can go to <a href="https://memory.net/">Memory.net</a> and look for your specific computer model. As general steps, select your computer's system in <em>By system</em>, then select the series and then select the specific model of the series. You will then see available memories to buy from memory.net. You can also simply read the documentation at the bottom. The memory type supported by your computer will be explained. Then you can buy the memory needed from any other computer store. </p>
<p>For servers, you can check with Cloudninja's documentation <a href="https://cloudninjas.com/pages/server-memory">here</a>. Search for your specific hardware and look for the compatible memory. This reference is good for rack and tower servers.</p>

How can I achieve dual channel configuration with sticks of RAM?</a></h3>
<p>First, always use RAM sticks of the same size and type. It should be noted on your motherboard which slots to populate first. As a general guide, there is usually 2 slots A and B, with each 2 memory stick entries. You must then install the ram sticks on A1 and B1 in order to achieve dual channel, then A2 and B2 if you have more (visual order: A1 A2 B1 B2).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: You want to start with your largest sticks, evenly distributed between both processors and work your way down to your smallest. Let's take an example with 2 processors as well as 4x 16GB sticks and 4x 8GB sticks. The arrangement would be A1-16GB, B1-16GB, A2-16GB, B2-16GB, A3-8GB, B3-8GB, A4-8GB, B4-8GB. Avoid odd numbers as well. You optimally want pairs. So if you only have 5x 8GB sticks, only install 4 until you have an even 6.</p>

<p>Be careful when installing memory on a server. Always check your server's documentation to make sure your RAM sticks combination are correct. </p>
<p>For example, on the Dell R720, you can have 24x16gb RAM ECC sticks, but it can only handle 16 Quad ranked DIMMs. In this case, you can fill up all slots with registered DIMMs if you have a maximum of 4 quad DIMMS ranked on each CPU.</p>

<p>Because we want to know that the node is still available (is still there to be used). A farmer can unplug a node at any time so we can't distinct a node that has been unplugged from a node that is off.</p>

<p>We could do that, but as we are in the testing phase right now, it is not a good idea. But since The farmer is already able to configure the capacity planning rule: the percentage of how much unused resources he/she wants to be available, this deemed to be unnecessary. Whenever that percentage is reached a new node is powered on.</p>

<p>Yes, that is a requirement. Nodes are powered on by other nodes (WOL packet comes from one of the nodes in the farm). So if you want to be able to power them back on you have to have at least one node powered on.</p>

<p>The Farmerbot can run on any computer/server, it could even run on a laptop so to speak, as long as it has an internet connection, the Farmerbot will be working fine.</p>
<p>The Farmerbot runs fine on a VM with a single vcore and 2GB of RAM. For the storage, you need to have room for Docker and its dependencies. Thus 1 or 2GB of free storage, with the OS already installed, should be sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-a-way-to-access-more-error-checking"><a class="header" href="#is-there-a-way-to-access-more-error-checking">Is there a way to access more error checking?</a></h3>
<p>Yes. In the config-path where you run the docker-compose, you have more logging for error checking. Under the directory where you set up your Farmerbot, you have the directory “config” in there where it creates a *.log file if you start the bot via Docker-Compose. In this directory, you can search for errors if something doesn't work as expected.</p>

<p>Yes. How much depends on where you run the farmerbot and how many nodes it will power on/off. If you run the farmerbot on a node on the grid you will have to pay TFT to rent that node (or deploy on that node). Next to that, you will have to pay the transaction fees every time the farmerbot has to wakeup a node or shutdown a node. This is with the account tied to the twin of your farm. On average each node in the farm will be shutdown and powered on at least once a day (periodic wakeup). In that case the average cost per month to power on nodes and shut them back down equals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cost per month = 0.001 TFT (extrinsic fee) * amount of nodes * 30 * 2 (1 for powering down, one for powering up)</p>

What can I do to fix this issue?</a></h3>
<p>This means that you do not have sufficient funds (TFT) in your wallet for the Farmerbot's fees.</p>
<p>You thus simply need to add some TFTs in the wallet that is connected to the farm on which you are running the Farmerbot. 1 TFT can suffice for many transactions. </p>

<h3 id="how-are-dedicated-nodes-power-managed"><a class="header" href="#how-are-dedicated-nodes-power-managed">How are dedicated nodes power managed?</a></h3>
<p>Dedicated nodes are managed like any other node. Nodes marked as dedicated can only be rented completely. Whenever a user wants to rent a dedicated node the user sends a find_node job to the farmerbot. The farmerbot will find such a node, power it on if it is down and reserve the full node (for 30 minutes). The user can then proceed with creating a rent contract for that node. The farmerbot will get that information and keep that node powered on. It will no longer return that node as a possible node in future find_node jobs. Whenever the rent contract is canceled the farmerbot will notice this and shutdown the node if the resource usage allows it.</p>

<li>Download the new docker-compose file: <code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldtech/farmerbot/development/docker-compose.yaml</code></li>
<li>Modify the .env file: rename <code>MNEMONIC</code> to <code>SECRET</code></li>
<li>Stop the existing farmerbot: <code>docker compose rm -f -s -v</code></li>
<li>Make a copy of the farmerbot log file: <code>cp config/farmerbot.log config/farmerbot.log.archive</code></li>
<li>Run the new farmerbot: <code>docker compose up -d</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This last command can take some time as it is downloading new docker images. Let the farmerbot run for some time.

<h3 id="can-i-run-multiple-farmerbots-on-a-single-computer-how-can-i-install-a-second-farmerbot-for-a-different-farm-on-the-same-computer"><a class="header" href="#can-i-run-multiple-farmerbots-on-a-single-computer-how-can-i-install-a-second-farmerbot-for-a-different-farm-on-the-same-computer">Can I run multiple Farmerbots on a single computer? How can I install a second Farmerbot for a different farm on the same computer?</a></h3>
<p>You can run multiple Farmerbots on the same computer, as long as each Farmerbot is associated with only one farm. Note that you also need to have a separate twin for each farm. Currently, each Farmerbot can only control a single twin account, and each twin should only oversee a single farm.</p>
<p>You can follow the same process as with the first Farmerbot, with the new seed phrase associated with the new farm. You simply need to install the second Farmerbot in a different directory and it won't interfere with the other Farmerbot. This means that  each Farmerbot will need its own <code>.env</code> and <code>config</code> files.</p>

Is this an expected behaviour?</a></h3>
<p>Yes, this is an expected behaviour. When you restart the Farmerbot, it will then proceed to reboot all the 3Nodes of your farm.</p>

How can I generate new log files for the Farmerbot?</a></h3>
<p>You can always get the logs from docker too via <code>docker compose logs</code> (run this command in the folder where your docker compose file is located). You can restart the Farmerbot to start the logging to file again (keep in mind that it will execute the periodic wakeup for all nodes at startup).</p>
<p>You should also make sure that you didn't use a different file structure.</p>

<h3 id="when-running-the-farmerbot-i-get-the-following-error-unauthorizedtochangepowertarget-what-can-i-do-to-fix-this"><a class="header" href="#when-running-the-farmerbot-i-get-the-following-error-unauthorizedtochangepowertarget-what-can-i-do-to-fix-this">When running the Farmerbot, I get the following: &quot;error: UnauthorizedToChangePowerTarget&quot;. What can I do to fix this?</a></h3>
<p>It means that the twin associated with the <code>SECRET</code> you loaded into the Farmerbot is not the owner of the farm. In other words, this error means that you provided a wrong mnemonic. </p>
<p>Note that only the twin of the farm is able to set the node power on chain (<code>setNodePower</code>). </p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-manually-change-the-farmerbots-power-target-of-my-3nodes"><a class="header" href="#how-can-i-manually-change-the-farmerbots-power-target-of-my-3nodes">How can I manually change the Farmerbot's power target of my 3Nodes?</a></h3>
<p>If you know which nodes are down, you can change the power target manually in the Polkadot extrinsics.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.grid.tf#/extrinsics">this link</a>. Then do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under, <code>submit the following extrinsics</code>, choose the following:
<ul>
<li><code>tfgridModule</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, select the following parameter:
<ul>
<li><code>changePowerTarget(nodeId, powerTarget)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under <code>nodeID</code>, enter the 3Node ID</li>
<li>Then, select the power target's status
<ul>
<li><code>powerTarget</code> (up or down)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click <code>submit transaction</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You need to use the TFChain secret from the farm page on the TFConnect app as the <code>SECRET</code>, which is in HEX format. The main template should look like this: <code>SECRET=&quot;0x12345ABCDEF...&quot;</code></p>
